   abstract = {We present two non-intrusive, laser-based imaging techniques for the quantitative measurement of water fluid film thickness. The diagnostics methods are based on laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) of the organic tracer ethyl acetoacetate added to the liquid in sub-percent (by mass) concentration levels, and on spontaneous Raman scattering of liquid water, respectively, both with excitation at 266 nm. Signal intensities were calibrated with measurements on liquid layers of known thickness in a range between 0 and 500 µm. Detection via an image doubler and appropriate filtering in both light paths enabled the simultaneous detection of two-dimensional liquid film thickness information from both methods. The thickness of water films on transparent quartz glass plates was determined with an accuracy of 9% for the tracer LIF and 15% for the Raman scattering technique, respectively. The combined LIF/Raman measurements also revealed a preferential evaporation of the current tracer during the time-resolved recording of film evaporation .},

   abstract = {Infrared (IR) image fusion is designed to fuse several IR images into a comprehensive image to boost imaging quality and reduce redundancy information, and image matching is an indispensable step. However, Conventional matching techniques are susceptible to the noise and fuzzy edges in IR images and it is therefore very desirable to have a matching algorithm that is tolerant to them. This paper presents a method for infrared image matching based on the SUSAN corner detection. To solve the problems of the traditional SUSAN algorithm including the fixed threshold of gray value difference and the failed detection of symmetry corners, an adaptive threshold extraction method is raised in this study. Furthermore, an attached double ring mask is used to improve the complex corner detection capability. A constraint condition and a principle of gravity are adopted to filtrate the candidate corners. The proposed method is qualitatively and quantitatively evaluated on IR images in the experiments. In comparison with other methods, better performance has been achieved.},

The main goal of this survey is to summarize the progress achieved to date and to help identify the sensing technologies that provide high detection accuracy and meet requirements related to cost and ease of installation. Special attention is paid to wireless battery-powered detectors of small dimensions that can be quickly and effortlessly installed alongside traffic lanes (on the side of a road or on a curb) without any additional supporting structures. The comparison of detection methods presented in this paper is based on results of experiments that were conducted with a variety of sensors in a wide range of configurations. During experiments various sensor sets were analyzed. It was shown that the detection accuracy can be significantly improved by fusing data from appropriately selected set of sensors. The experimental results reveal that accurate vehicle detection can be achieved by using sets of passive sensors. Application of active sensors was necessary to obtain satisfactory results in case of pedestrian detection.},

One of those features are face detection. Face detection is the most basic process of any face processing operations. Most digital images are stored in the form of RGB (Red, Green, Blue) data. In this research, detection of human face features is done by using different RGB values in digital images. After applying skin tone color segmentation on digital images, detection area will be optimized using human head properties by eliminating non-human face skin tone area. The experiment shows that the detection is mostly accurate for images but there is issue on low light face skin color captured by digital cameras. From the experiment of our model using 10 sample face images, face can be detected on 9 of them, while in 1 image, the face cannot be detected at all because of low light condition.},

When Cerenkov luminescence data are collected, the high-energy particles from the radioactive nucleus will be detected by the sensitive CCD camera and lead to impulse noise. To suppress the impulse noise and improve the contrast of the useful signal to the background, the detection-based fuzzy switching median filtering framework is proposed in this paper. Several experiments were conducted respectively to investigate the statistical feature of the noise and to evaluate the performance of the proposed noise removal framework. The results show that the signal-to-noise ratio is improved after noise elimination. The proposed filtering framework outperforms the classical median filter in terms of root mean squared error and the structural similarity index. It also preserves the maximum value and the mean value in the regions of interest better than the median filter does. In addition, compared with the FLICMCDD algorithm, the proposed method works much faster while getting similar results.},

These devices have a complex statistical behaviour that is often not fully considered in the analysis of EMCCD data. Robust and optimal analysis of EMCCD images requires an understanding of their noise properties, in particular to exploit fully the advantages of Bayesian and maximum-likelihood analysis techniques, whose value is increasingly recognised in biological imaging for obtaining robust quantitative measurements from challenging data. To improve our own EMCCD analysis and as an effort to aid that of the wider bioimaging community, we present, explain and discuss a detailed physical model for EMCCD noise properties, giving a likelihood function for image counts in each pixel for a given incident intensity, and we explain how to measure the parameters for this model from various calibration images. © 2013 Hirsch et al.},

Laboratory and semi-pilot trials using a Wet End Simulator indicated that the combination of an electrochemically produced halogen-containing oxidant and percarbonate was an efficient new biocide concept, especially in fine papermaking. Addition of percarbonate considerably reduced the need of halogen containing biocides, thus lessening risk of corrosion. The trials with samples from fine paper machines indicated that the new concept required halogenated biocides to be dosed first, and the time delay between additions of biocide needed to be sufficient to ensure that no residual halogen left when percarbonate was added. Electrochemical generation enables on-site biocide production which decreases transportation cost, risk associated with storage of hazardous chemicals and biocide lost due to degradation. Thus, on-site generation of biocides together with potential reduction in amount of halogen containing oxidants make this dual concept economically attractive and environmentally positive.},

In this paper, we attempt to develop a basic methodology that can be used to discover how sensitive the recognition process is to inaccuracies in facial feature detection from front-view ID-type images. We apply this methodology to face measurements involving the eyes, mouth, cheeks and chin in order to discover how recognition is affected by measurement inaccuracies. We subsequently judge the quality of our facial feature detection modules by using the recognition sensitivity to individual face measurements. An important point of discussion is the link between measurement and feature inaccuracies.

This work is distinguished by three key contributions. The first is the introduction of a new image representation called the "Integral Image" which allows the features used by our detector to be computed very quickly. The second is a learning algorithm, based on AdaBoost, which selects a small number of critical visual features from a larger set and yields extremely efficient classifiers[6]. The third contribution is a method for combining increasingly more complex classi-fiers in a "cascade" which allows background regions of the image to be quickly discarded while spending more computation on promising object-like regions. The cascade can be viewed as an object specific focus-of-attention mechanism which unlike previous approaches provides statistical guarantees that discarded regions are unlikely to contain the object of interest. In the domain of face detection the system yields detection rates comparable to the best previous systems. Used in real-time applications, the detector runs at 15 frames per second without resorting to image differenc-ing or skin color detection.},

This paper describes an unsu-pervised data driven Bayesian clustering algorithm which has detection of individual entities as its primary goal. We track simple image features and probabilistically group them into clusters representing independently moving entities. The numbers of clusters and the grouping of constituent features are determined without supervised learning or any subject-specific model. The new approach is instead , that space-time proximity and trajectory coherence through image space are used as the only probabilistic criteria for clustering. An important contribution of this work is how these criteria are used to perform a one-shot data association without iterating through combinatorial hypotheses of cluster assignments. Our proposed general detection algorithm can be augmented with subject-specific filtering, but is shown to already be effective at detecting individual entities in crowds of people, insects, and animals. This paper and the associated video examine the implementation and experiments of our motion clustering framework.},

   abstract = {In its full generality, motion analysis of crowded objects necessitates recognition and segmentation of each moving entity. The difficulty of these tasks increases considerably with occlusions and therefore with crowding. When the objects are constrained to be of the same kind, however, partitioning of densely crowded semi-rigid objects can be accomplished by means of clustering tracked feature points. We base our approach on a highly parallelized version of the KLT tracker in order to process the video into a set of feature trajectories. While such a set of trajectories provides a substrate for motion analysis, their unequal lengths and fragmented nature present difficulties for subsequent processing. To address this, we propose a simple means of spatially and temporally conditioning the trajectories. Given this representation, we integrate it with a learned object descriptor to achieve a segmentation of the constituent motions. We present experimental results for the problem of estimating the number of moving objects in a dense crowd as a function of time.},

This work is distinguished by three key contributions. The first is the introduction of a new image representation called the "Integral Image" which allows the features used by our detector to be computed very quickly. The second is a learning algorithm, based on AdaBoost, which selects a small number of critical visual features from a larger set and yields extremely efficient classifiers. The third contribution is a method for combining increasingly more complex classifiers in a "cascade" which allows background regions of the image to be quickly discarded while spending more computation on promising object-like regions. The cascade can be viewed as an object specific focus-of-attention mechanism which unlike previous approaches provides statistical guarantees that discarded regions are unlikely to contain the object of interest. In the domain of face detection the system yields detection rates comparable to the best previous systems. Used in real-time applications, the detector runs at 15 frames per second without resorting to image differencing or skin color detection.},

   abstract = {Image Fusion is a process of combining the relevant information from a set of images, into a single image, wherein the resultant fused image will be more informative and complete than any of the input images. This paper discusses the implementation of three categories of image fusion algorithms-the basic fusion algorithms, the pyramid based algorithms and the basic DWT algorithms, developed as an Image Fusion Toolkit-ImFus, using Visual C++ 6.0. The objective of the paper is to assess the wide range of algorithms together, which is not found in the literature. The fused images were assessed using Structural Similarity Image Metric (SSIM) [10], Laplacian Mean Squared Error along with seven other simple image quality metrics that helped us measure the various image features; which were also implemented as part of the toolkit. The readings produced by the image quality metrics, based on the image quality of the fused images, were used to assess the algorithms. We used Pareto Optimization method to figure out the algorithm that consistently had the image quality metrics produce the best readings. An assessment of the quality of the fused images was additionally performed with the help of ten respondents based on their visual perception, to verify the results produced by the metric based assessment. Coincidentally, both the assessment methods matched in their raking of the algorithms. The Pareto Optimization method picked DWT with Haar fusion method as the one with the best image quality metrics readings. The result here was substantiated by the visual perception based method where it was inferred that fused images produced by DWT with Haar fusion method was marked the best 63.33% of times which was far better than any other algorithm. Both the methods also matched in assessing Morphological Pyramid method as producing fused images of inferior quality.},

The detection technique begins with wall image acquisition. The acquired image is processed through two crack detectors which follow different edge tracking algorithms such as Hyperbolic Tangent (HBT) filtering and canny edge detection algorithm. The main advantage of the proposed model is that it combines the best features of both Canny's filtering and HBT filtering techniques. It also fulfills the three necessary vital criteria, i.e. accurate edge detection, localization and minimal response, making the crack detection process more robust and reliable. The fusion of detector responses are performed using Haar Discrete Wavelet Transform (HDWT) and maximum-approximation with mean-detail image fusion algorithm to get more prominent detection of crack edges. The proposed system gives improved edge detection in images with superior edge localization and higher PSNR.},

Current digital cameras and post-processing methods allow verifying qualitatively the state of conservation of wide areas of concrete in dams and bridges. When dealing with building refurbishments and rehabilitation, it is important to verify that existing structural elements fit the requirements of the standards; in the case of structures formed by traditional RC joists, cracking of the bottom-face provides information about the serviceability of these elements. This research proposed and put in practice through experimental tests an image post-processing method for quantification of cracking (five specimens were used and calibrated). Based on a sequence of shots and through a complex step-by-step post-processing, cracks were identified and measured to calibrate this method for real purposes. The method quantifies the crack opening width and spacing by analyzing the bottom-face of the joists through the shots. Measured values of crack spacing are very similar to those predicted by the standards, while the values of crack opening width differ more from theoretical ones due to the scattering of results. However, the proposed method has been proved as suitable and useful for fast inspections of RC elements under bending.</p>},

Since the manual approach completely depends on the specialist's knowledge and experience, it lacks objectivity in the quantitative analysis. So, automatic image-based crack detection is proposed as a replacement. Literature presents different techniques to automatically identify the crack and its depth using image processing techniques. In this research, a detailed survey is conducted to identify the research challenges and the achievements till in this field. Accordingly, 50 research papers are taken related to crack detection, and those research papers are reviewed. Based on the review, analysis is provided based on the image processing techniques, objectives, accuracy level, error level, and the image data sets.

   abstract = {Concrete probes in civil engineering material testing often show fissures or hairline-cracks. These cracks develop dynamically. Starting at a width of a few microns, they usually cannot be detected visually or in an image of a camera imaging the whole probe. Conventional image analysis techniques will detect fissures only if they show a width in the order of one pixel. To be able to detect and measure fissures with a width of a fraction of a pixel at an early stage of their development, a cascaded image analysis approach has been developed, implemented and tested. The basic idea of the approach is to detect discontinuities in dense surface deformation vector fields. These deformation vector fields between consecutive stereo image pairs, which are generated by cross correlation or least squares matching, show a precision in the order of 1/50 pixel. Hairline-cracks can be detected and measured by applying edge detection techniques such as a Sobel operator to the results of the image matching process. Cracks will show up as linear discontinuities in the deformation vector field and can be vectorized by edge chaining. In practical tests of the method, cracks with a width of 1/20 pixel could be detected, and their width could be determined at a precision of 1/50 pixel. ©2009 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc.

To deal with this challenge, we developed a computer vision-based system for automated, rapid and accurate yield estimation. The system uses a two-camera stereo rig for image acquisition. It works at nighttime with controlled artificial lighting to reduce the variance of natural illumination. An autonomous orchard vehicle is used as the support platform for automated data collection. The system scans both sides of each tree row in orchards. A computer vision algorithm detects and registers apples from acquired sequential images, and then generates apple counts as crop yield estimation. We deployed the yield estimation system in Washington state in September, 2011. The results show that the system works well with both red and green apples in the tall-spindle planting system.

Images of mango trees were acquired over a three day period, 3weeks before commercial harvest occurred. The fruit load of each of fifteen trees was manually counted, and these trees were imaged on four sides. Correlation between tree counts and manual image counts was strong (R2=0.91 for two sides). A further 555 trees were imaged on one side only. For these images, pixels were segmented into fruit and background pixels using colour segmentation in the RGB and YCbCr colour ranges and a texture segmentation based on adjacent pixel variability. Resultant blobs were counted to obtain a per image mango count. Across a set of 555 images (with mean±standard deviation of fruit per tree of 32.3±14.3), a linear regression, (y=0.582x-0.20, R2=0.74, bias adjusted root mean square error of prediction=7.7) was achieved on the machine vision count relative to the image count. The algorithm decreased in effectiveness as the number of fruit on the tree increased, and when imaging conditions involved direct sunlight.

The equipment needed to apply the method is made up of a digital camera (or a still video-camera in case a high frequency in data acquisition is necessary), an orientation frame which establishes the object reference system, a pair of signalized supports to be placed in a permanent way on both sides of the crack to compute deformations; however, permanent targets are mandatory only for case (ii).

   abstract = {Modern cancer diagnosis requires histological, molecular, and genomic tumor analyses. Tumor sampling is often achieved using a targeted needle biopsy approach. Targeting errors and cancer heterogeneity causing inaccurate sampling are important limitations of this blind technique leading to non-diagnostic or poor quality samples, and the need for repeated biopsies pose elevated patient risk. An optical technology that can analyze the molecular nature of the tissue prior to harvesting could improve cancer targeting and mitigate patient risk. Here we report on the design, development, and validation of an in situ intraoperative, label-free, cancer detection system based on high wavenumber Raman spectroscopy. This optical detection device was engineered into a commercially available biopsy system allowing tumor analysis prior to tissue harvesting without disrupting workflow. Using a dual validation approach we show that high wavenumber Raman spectroscopy can detect human dense cancer with >60% cancer cells in situ during surgery with a sensitivity and specificity of 80% and 90%, respectively. We also demonstrate for the first time the use of this system in a swine brain biopsy model. These studies set the stage for the clinical translation of this optical molecular imaging method for high yield and safe targeted biopsy. Most solid cancers are discovered by conventional imaging techniques such as computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET), and ultrasound (US). While these images characterize the location(s) and anatomical relationships of the cancer, most of them have limitations in terms of tumor grading and molecular characterization. Consequently, direct sampling for histological, molecular, and genomic characterisation is required for diagnosis and treatment planning. The quality of the tissue obtained for analysis is thus of vital importance to guide the clinical trajectory. Furthermore, as targeted therapies are known to cause imaging changes that appear to represent cancer progression, but are in fact only imaging changes caused by the treatments, oncology teams require high quality tumor sampling during and post-treatment in order to make correct treatment decisions 1. As the use of these new therapies becomes more common the need for new and more informed tissue sampling approaches are needed. To aid tumor targeting, biopsies are performed using approaches guided by conventional imaging such as US, CT, and MRI. Since these imaging techniques do not provide the user information regarding the nature of},

   abstract = {Raman spectroscopy can be used to measure the chemical composition of a sample, which can in turn be used to extract biological information. Many materials have characteristic Raman spectra, which means that Raman spectroscopy has proven to be an effective analytical approach in geology, semiconductor, materials and polymer science fields. The application of Raman spectroscopy and microscopy within biology is rapidly increasing because it can provide chemical and compositional information, but it does not typically suffer from interference from water molecules. Analysis does not conventionally require extensive sample preparation; biochemical and structural information can usually be obtained without labeling. In this protocol, we aim to standardize and bring together multiple experimental approaches from key leaders in the field for obtaining Raman spectra using a microspectrometer. As examples of the range of biological samples that can be analyzed, we provide instructions for acquiring Raman spectra, maps and images for fresh plant tissue, formalin-fixed and fresh frozen mammalian tissue, fixed cells and biofluids. We explore a robust approach for sample preparation, instrumentation, acquisition parameters and data processing. By using this approach, we expect that a typical Raman experiment can be performed by a nonspecialist user to generate high-quality data for biological materials analysis.},

In this field, Cherenkov luminescence imaging (CLI) seems to be very attractive by allowing imaging with clinical PET radiotracers with high-throughput capabilities. In this context, we developed a fast CLI method to detect tumour hypoxia with 18 F-fluoromisonidazole (FMISO) for drug development purposes. Methods: Colon cancer model was induced in mice by subcutaneous injection of 1 × 10 6 CT-26 cells. FMISO was injected, and simultaneous PET-blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD)-MRI followed by CLI were performed along with immunohistochemistry staining with pimonidazole. Results: There was a significant correlation between FMISO PET and CLI tumour uptakes, consistent with the BOLD-MRI mapping. Tumour-to-background ratio was significantly higher for CLI compared with PET and MRI. Immunohistochemistry confirmed tumour hypoxia. The imaging workflow with CLI was about eight times faster than the PET-MRI procedure. Conclusion: CLI is a fast and relevant tool to assess tumour hypoxia. This approach could be particularly interesting for hypoxia-targeting drug development.},

Čerenkov Luminescence Imaging (CLI) has desirable capabilities for niche applications, using specially designed measurement systems that report on radiation distributions, radiotracer and nanoparticle concentrations, and are directly applied to procedures such as medicine assessment, endoscopy, surgery, quality assurance and dosimetry. When compared to the other imaging tools such as PET and SPECT, CLI can have the key advantage of lower cost, higher throughput and lower imaging time. CLI can also provide imaging and dosimetry information from both radioisotopes and linear accelerator irradiation. The relatively short range of optical photon transport in tissue means that direct Čerenkov luminescence imaging is restricted to small animals or near surface human use. Use of Čerenkov-excitation for additional molecular probes, is now emerging as a key tool for biosensing or radiosensitization.

   abstract = {I still recall with great pleasure the exclamation of the greatest scientist of that epoch, Niels Bohrd"Wunderbar, Wunderschön", repeated several times after I demonstrated to him one of the most essential properties of the radiation, namely its space symmetry. Nevertheless, the atmosphere of distrust of the new effect [Cherenkov Effect] from scientific opinion remained. The most open and sharp manifestation of this distrust was the refusal by the journal Nature to publish a short paper, summarizing the essence of the phenomena and its main properties. Pavel A. Cherenkov (1986), relating his reaction to the rejection of his work by the editors of Nature and the reactions of the scientific community. (From Cherenkov, P.A., 1986. At the threshold of discovery. Nucl. Instrum. Methods Phys. Res. Sect A 248, 1e4.) 16.1 INTRODUCTION Photons of visible radiation are produced when a charged particle travels through a transparent medium at a speed greater than the speed of light in that medium. The medium may be any liquid or solid provided it is transparent. These photons are referred to as Cherenkov radiation, in honor of the Russian physicist Pavel A. Cerenkov for his basic research and discovery of the properties of this unique radiation (see Cherenkov, 1934a, 1937d). The process that gives rise to Cherenkov photons is referred to as the Cherenkov effect. In the scientific literature, four variations of the contemporary spelling or naming of Cerenkov radiation can be found, namely, (1) Cerenkov radiation, after the Russian, which is the spelling used by Pavel Cerenkov in his original papers (Cherenkov, 1934a,b, 1936, 1937aed, 1938aec); (2) Vavilove Cerenkov radiation, in honor also of Sergei Ivanovich Vavilov (1891e1951), who was the doctoral research advisor to Pavel Cerenkov during the pioneering discoveries; (3) Cherenkov radiation, which provides the English pronunciation for the Russian C; this is also the spelling used by Pavel Cherenkov (1986) in his last publication, and it is the spelling adopted by the Nobel Foundation (http://nobelprize.org/index.html); and (4) Cerenkov radiation, which is the anglicized version. All four versions of the spelling are found in the current scientific literature. Throughout this chapter, the writer will adopt the spelling Cherenkov, for the following reasons: (1) it conforms with that used by Pavel Cherenkov in his last paper (Cherenkov, 1986), entitled "At the Threshold of Discovery," which appeared in the journal Nuclear Instruments and Methods in Physics Research; (2) it is the spelling adopted by Chemical Abstracts; (3) it is the spelling adopted by the Nobel Foundation; and (4) it is the spelling adopted most often by authors of papers in the journal Nuclear Instruments and Methods in Physics Research. The Cherenkov effect and the resulting radiation produced by a charged particle traveling in a transparent medium at a velocity exceeding the speed of light in that medium were predicted theoretically as early as 1888 by Oliver Heaviside (1888, 1889, 1892, 1899, 1912a,b), but long forgotten until the radiation was discovered finally by Cherenkov (see Cherenkov, 1934a,b) and interpreted by Frank and Tamm (1937). Heaviside's early prediction was based on a traveling point charge, as the electron was not discovered by J.J. Thompson until 1897. Govorkov (2005) reviewed the historical significance of Heaviside's prediction, namely, that Heaviside first predicted theoretically that a point charge (eg, electron) would produce a conical wave front whenever it were to travel at a speed greater than the speed of light in a medium. Heaviside's prediction was before Einstein's theory of relativity, which holds that matter cannot travel faster than light in a vacuum; however, matter can travel faster than light in a medium. In the time of Heaviside, even outer space was not considered to be a vacuum but to consist of an "ether," and therefore, according to Heaviside, the conical wave front would be produced in the ether as well as any other medium provided the point charge travels at a speed exceeding that of light. In the words of Govorkov (2005): A genius, Heaviside was half a century in advance of his time in his calculations and predictions, but unfortunately he was not understood by his contemporaries. His works were forgotten, and scientists had to start from the beginning, this time from experiment [i.e., the experiments and discovery by Cherenkov (see Cherenkov 1934a,b, 1936, 1937aed, 1938aec)].

   abstract = {As discussed in Chapter 1, Introduction, radioactivity was first detected when radiation interacted with material on photographic plates. Further studies of radioactivity have indicated that radiation may interact with matter in many other ways. The ionizing effect of radiation has been recognized very early. It has also been observed that the degree of the ionization strongly depends on the type of radiation. Rutherford called the radiation with the smallest range "alpha radiation", the radiation with intermediate range "beta radiation", and the radiation with the highest range "gamma radiation". The radiation causes transitional or permanent physical and chemical changes in the molecules that interact with the radiation. For the interpretation of these interactions, let us look at how energy transitions from radiation to matter and the ensuing changes. To do this, both particles (radiation) and their interactions with matter have to be classified. The particles can be classified on the basis of their characteristic properties, the charge, and rest mass. Accordingly, there are charged and neutral particles, and heavy and light particles (Table 5.1). As seen in Table 5.1, the particles, especially their rest mass, cover a large range, and as such, they can participate in various interactions depending on which part of a substance they interact with and on the mechanism type of the interaction. For example, the reaction of radiation with matter can involve the electron orbitals, the nuclear field, and the nucleus. The particles can partially or totally transfer their energy to matter, can be absorbed, or can be scattered elastically or nonelastically. Furthermore, as a consequence to the interaction, the matter undergoes excitation or ionization, or nuclear resonance or nuclear reactions can be induced. The interactions between radiation and matter may be strong, intermediate, or weak. All these possibilities are summarized in Fig. 5.1. In Fig. 5.1, the first three branches show what can happen to the radiation, and the last three branches indicate the changes that they induce in matter. This classification also allows quantitative characterization of the changes that result from the interaction. The changes in the particles of radiation can be mathematically described, assuming that the 85 Nuclear and Radiochemistry.},

The goal of this work was to develop a complete theoretical foundation for the detectable signal strength, in order to provide guidance on optimization of the limits of detection and how to optimize near real time imaging. The key parameters affecting photon production, propagation and detection were considered and experimental validation with both tissue phantoms and a murine model are shown. Both the theoretical analysis and experimental data indicate that the detection level is near a single photon-per-pixel for the detection geometry and frame rates commonly used, with the strongest factor being the signal decrease with the square of distance from tissue to camera. Experimental data demonstrates how the SNR improves with increasing integration time, but only up to the point where the dominance of camera read noise is overcome by stray photon noise that cannot be suppressed. For the current camera in a fixed geometry, the signal to background ratio limits the detection of light signals, and the observed in vivo Cherenkov emission is on the order of 100× stronger than CEL signals. As a result, imaging signals from depths <15 mm is reasonable for Cherenkov light, and depths <3 mm is reasonable for CEL imaging. The current investigation modeled Cherenkov and CEL imaging of two oxygen sensing phosphorescent compounds, but the modularity of the code allows for easy comparison of different agents or alternative cameras, geometries or tissues.},

Then, we discuss in detail recent progresses in multiple input multiple output transceiver design for mmWave communications.

This in turn guides production of a three-dimensional printed device that encloses the entire synthetic route internally via simple operations. We demonstrate the approach for the g-aminobutyric acid receptor agonist, (±)-baclofen, establishing a concept that paves the way for the local manufacture of drugs outside of specialist facilities.},

In turn, this system could accelerate the digital healthcare revolution, enabling medicines to be tailored to the individual needs of each patient on demand. To date, a variety of FDM 3D printed medical products (e.g. implants) have been com-mercialised for clinical use. However, within pharmaceuticals, certain regulatory hurdles still remain.

   abstract = {Novel approaches toward understanding the evolution of disease can lead to the discovery of biomarkers that will enable better management of disease progression and improve prognostic evaluation. Raman spectroscopy is a promising investigative and diagnostic tool that can assist in uncovering the molecular basis of disease and provide objective, quantifiable molecular information for diagnosis and treatment evaluation. This technique probes molecular vibrations/rotations associated with chemical bonds in a sample to obtain information on molecular structure, composition, and intermolecular interactions. Raman scattering occurs when light interacts with a molecular vibration/rotation and a change in polarizability takes place during molecular motion. This results in light being scattered at an optical frequency shifted (up or down) from the incident light. By monitoring the intensity profile of the inelastically scattered light as a function of frequency, the unique spectroscopic fingerprint of a tissue sample is obtained. Since each sample has a unique composition, the spectroscopic profile arising from Raman-active functional groups of nucleic acids, proteins, lipids, and carbohydrates allows for the evaluation, characterization, and discrimination of tissue type. This review provides an overview of the theory of Raman spectroscopy, instrumentation used for measurement , and variation of Raman spectroscopic techniques for clinical applications in cancer, including detection of brain, ovarian, breast, prostate, and pancreatic cancers and circulating tumor cells.},

In this article, we present the challenges in unravelling the molecule-specific Raman spectral signatures of different biomolecules like proteins, nucleic acids, lipids and carbohydrates based on the review of our work and the current trends in these areas. We also show how Raman spectroscopy can be used to probe the secondary and tertiary structural changes occurring during thermal denaturation of protein and lysozyme as well as more complex biological systems like bacteria. Complex biological systems like tissues, cells, blood serum etc. are also made up of such biomolecules. Using mice liver and blood serum, it is shown that different tissues yield their unique signature Raman spectra, owing to a difference in the relative composition of the biomolecules. Additionally, recent progress in Raman spectroscopy for diagnosing a multitude of diseases ranging from cancer to infection is also presented. The second part of this article focuses on applications of Raman spectroscopy to materials. As a first example, Raman spectroscopy of a melt cast explosives formulation was carried out to monitor the changes in the peaks which indicates the potential of this technique for remote process monitoring. The second example presents various modern methods of Raman spectroscopy such as spatially offset Raman spectroscopy (SORS), reflection, transmission and universal multiple angle Raman spectroscopy (UMARS) to study layered materials. Studies on chemicals/layered materials hidden in non-metallic containers using the above variants are presented. Using suitable examples, it is shown how a specific excitation or collection geometry can yield different information about the location of materials. Additionally, it is shown that UMARS imaging can also be used as an effective tool to obtain layer specific information of materials located at depths beyond a few centimeters.},

Methods: Colon cancer model was induced in mice by subcutaneous injection of 1 × 10 6 CT-26 cells. FMISO was injected, and simultaneous PET-blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD)-MRI followed by CLI were performed along with immunohistochemistry staining with pimonidazole. Results: There was a significant correlation between FMISO PET and CLI tumour uptakes, consistent with the BOLD-MRI mapping. Tumour-to-background ratio was significantly higher for CLI compared with PET and MRI. Immunohistochemistry confirmed tumour hypoxia. The imaging workflow with CLI was about eight times faster than the PET-MRI procedure. Conclusion: CLI is a fast and relevant tool to assess tumour hypoxia.

We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis regarding the diagnostic yield and postoperative mortality rate of surgical lung biopsy in patients with suspected interstitial lung diseases because of the wide variation in previously reported effectiveness and safety concerns. Methods We systematically searched for published studies between 2000 and 2014 evaluating surgical lung biopsy in the diagnosis of interstitial lung diseases. Subgroup analysis was performed to identify the possible source of study heterogeneity. Results Twenty-three studies contributed 2148 patients for the analysis. The median diagnostic yield was 95% (range, 42%-100%), with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis as the most frequent diagnosis (618, 33.5%). Surgical lung biopsy was mainly guided by high-resolution computed tomography manifestations. Biopsy site, biopsy number, and the surgical lung biopsy method may not be associated with the diagnostic accuracy. The pooled postoperative mortality rate for included studies was 3.6% (95% confidence interval, 2.1-5.5), with significant heterogeneity observed. Subgroup analysis revealed that exclusion criteria based on immunocompromised status, mechanical ventilation, and severe respiratory dysfunction (diffusing capacity of lung for carbon monoxide <35% or forced vital capacity <55% predicted), but not surgical lung biopsy technique or underlying interstitial lung disease subtype, may be possible sources of heterogeneity. Conclusions We demonstrated a satisfactory diagnostic performance with a favorable safety profile of surgical lung biopsy in the diagnosis of suspected interstitial lung diseases. Surgical lung biopsy is especially recommended in patients with clinical information indicative but atypical of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, whereas the benefit of surgical lung biopsy should be carefully balanced against the risk for patients with immunocompromised status, mechanical ventilation dependence, or severe respiratory dysfunction.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND. Stereotactic brain biopsy is considered by many physicians to have significant morbidity and mortality rates with a high risk of sampling error resulting in misdiagnosis. The technical aspects necessary to perform the procedure safely and effectively are unfamiliar to most physicians. METHODS. After reporting his initial results with stereotactic brain biopsy, several modifications were implemented by the author to improve the morbidity, mortality, and diagnostic yield rates, including complex surgical planning with regard to patient selection, biopsy trajectory, imaging technique, target choice, and intraoperative pathologic review. The results of implementing these modifications were examined retrospectively in 134 consecutive brain biopsies. RESULTS. One hundred and thirty-four stereotactic brain biopsies were performed in 122 patients. Computed tomography guidance was used in 85 patients (63%) and magnetic resonance imaging was used in 49 patients (37%). Sixty-four lesions (48%) were located in the right hemisphere, 61 (45%) in the left, and 9 (7%) in the midline. The most common diagnoses included 62 malignant brain tumors (46%), 24 benign brain tumors (18%), 23 neurologic disorders (17%), and 20 infections (15%). Five biopsies (4%) did not demonstrate a pathologic process for an overall diagnostic yield of 96%. Reasons for diagnostic failure included lesion location adjacent to the ventricular system, inaccurate targeting, and the inability to penetrate the tumor. One patient sustained a neurologic deficit after the biopsy for a morbidity rate of 0.7% and one sustained a fatal hemorrhage during the biopsy of a vascular tumor for a mortality rate of 0.7%. These results are comparable to those reported in 7471 biopsies (current series included) in which the morbidity rate was 3.5%, the mortality rate was 0.7%, and the diagnostic yield was 91%. CONCLUSIONS. Stereotactic brain biopsy is an extremely safe and effective procedure for evaluating intracranial lesions. Complex surgical planning can decrease the risk of potential complications and the use of intraoperative pathologic examination can improve the diagnostic yield for this procedure.},

   abstract = {In neurosurgical applications, a tool capable of distinguishing grey matter, white matter, and areas of tumor and/or necrosis in near-real time could greatly aid in tumor resection decision making. Raman spectroscopy is a non-destructive spectroscopic technique which provides molecular information about the tissue under examination based on the vibrational properties of the constituent molecules. With careful measurement and data processing, a spatial step and repeat acquisition of Raman spectra can be used to create Raman images. Forty frozen brain tissue sections were imaged in their entirety using a 300-µm-square measurement grid, and two or more regions of interest within each tissue were also imaged using a 25 µm-square step size. Molecular correlates for histologic features of interest were identified within the Raman spectra, and novel imaging algorithms were developed to compare molecular features across multiple tissues. In previous work, the relative concentration of individual biomolecules was imaged. Here, the relative concentrations of 1004, 1300:1344, and 1660 cm−1, which correspond primarily to protein and lipid content, were simultaneously imaged across all tissues. This provided simple interpretation of boundaries between grey matter, white matter, and diseased tissue, and corresponded with findings from adjacent hematoxylin and eosin-stained sections. This novel, yet simple, multi-channel imaging technique allows clinically-relevant resolution with straightforward molecular interpretation of Raman images not possible by imaging any single peak. This method can be applied to either surgical or laboratory tools for rapid, non-destructive imaging of grey and white matter.},

   abstract = {Biopsy is often used to investigate brain tumour-specific abnormalities so that treatments can be appropriately tailored. Dacomitinib (PF-00299804) is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), which is predicted to only be effective in cancers where the targets of this drug (EGFR, ERBB2, ERBB4) are abnormally active. Here we describe a method by which serial biopsy can be used to validate response to dacomitinib treatment in vivo using a mouse glio-blastoma model. In order to determine the feasibility of conducting serial brain biopsies in mouse models with minimal morbidity, and if successful, investigate whether this can facilitate evaluation of chemotherapeutic response, an orthotopic model of glioblastoma was used. Immunodeficient mice received cortical implants of the human glioblastoma cell line, U87MG, modified to express the constitutively-active EGFR mutant, EGFRvIII, GFP and luciferase. Tumour growth was monitored using bioluminescence imaging. Upon attainment of a moderate tumour size, free-hand biopsy was performed on a subgroup of animals. Animal monitoring using a neurological severity score (NSS) showed that all mice survived the procedure with minimal perioperative morbidity and recovered to similar levels as controls over a period of five days. The technique was used to evaluate dacomitinib-mediated inhibition of EGFRvIII two hours after drug administration. We show that serial tissue samples can be obtained, that the samples retain histological features of the tumour, and are of sufficient quality to determine response to treatment. This approach represents a significant advance in murine brain surgery that may be applicable to other brain tumour models. Importantly, the methodology has the potential to accelerate the preclinical in vivo drug screening process.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Despite improvements in imaging techniques, histopathological diagnosis is still an important tool in neuro-oncology. At Freiburg University Hospital in Germany, approximately 450 patients per year undergo a serial stereotactic biopsy to obtain a diagnosis. We analyzed the accuracy of intraoperative diagnosis for rapid establishment of treatment options. Furthermore, we wanted to find out whether the location and histopathology of the tumors as well as the age and sex of the patients affected accuracy. Because of the large number of biopsies performed per year, parameters could also be evaluated for rare cerebral lesions. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 5000 consecutive stereotactic brain biopsies from 4589 patients. The digital database comprises the intraoperative and final diagnoses, the location of the tumors, and the sex and age of the patients. Regression analysis was performed to identify parameters that had a significant impact on the results. RESULTS: Intraoperative diagnosis was correct in 90.3% of biopsies. This included complete correlation in 81.3% of the biopsies and partial correlation in 9% of the biopsies. In 5.1% of the biopsies, no correlation between the intraoperative and final diagnosis was obtained. In 4.6% of the biopsies, no diagnosis could be made during or after surgery. A high correlation was found for World Health Organization Type II astrocytomas and, with regression analysis, for World Health Organization Type I astrocytomas, glioblastomas, and metastases. CONCLUSION: Intraoperative diagnosis with stereotactic biopsy has high validity. Immediate treatment based on the intraoperative diagnosis can be justified (e.g., for metastases or glioblastomas). Stereotactic biopsy with an exact histopathological diagnosis is strongly recommended for planning adequate therapy for patients with unidentified brain lesions.},

   abstract = {Background Frameless stereotactic biopsies are replacing frame-based stereotaxy as a diagnostic approach to brain lesions. In order to avoid a sampling bias or negative histol-ogy, multiple specimens are often taken. This in turn increases the risk of hemorrhagic complications. Objective We present the use of 5-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA)-induced protoporphyrin IX fluorescence in frameless stereotaxy to improve the procedure duration and yield, and thereby reduce the risk of complications. Methods Patients with suspected high-grade brain tumors are given 5-ALA 4 h prior to stereotactic biopsy. The biopsy needle is guided to the target using frameless stereotaxy based either on preoperative images or combined with intra-operative MRI sequences. The specimen is illuminated with blue light to look for fluorescence. In case of a positive fluorescence within the tissue sample, no frozen sections are obtained, and no further specimens are taken. Results The samples of 13 patients revealed a positive fluorescence and were histologically confirmed as malignant or high-grade brain neoplasms. four cases were fluorescence-negative, requiring frozen section confirmation and/or multiple samples. In theses cases histology was either nonspecific gliotic changes or low-grade tumors. There were no complications related to the additional use of 5-ALA. Conclusion 5-ALA fluorescence in stereotactic biopsies can increase the safety and accuracy of these procedures by reducing sampling errors and eliminating the need for multiple samples and/or frozen section verification, creating a more accurate, faster and safer procedure for cases of suspected malignant or high-grade brain tumors situated in deep or eloquent areas.},

Needle-based OCT-measurements were performed on the prostate specimens. Attenuation coefficients were determined by an earlier described in-house developed software package. The mean attenuation coefficients (benign OCT data; malignant OCT data; p-value Mann-Whitney U test) were: (3.56 mm-1 ; 3.85 mm-1 ; p < 0.0001) for all patients combined. The area under the ROC curve was 0.64. In order to circumvent the effect of histopathology mismatching, we performed a sub-analysis on only OCT data in which tumor was visible in two subsequent histopathological prostate slices. This analysis could be performed in 3 patients. The mean attenuation coefficients (benign OCT data; malignant OCT data; p-value Mann-Whitney U test) were: (3.23 mm-1 ; 4.11 mm-1 ; p < 0.0001) for all patients grouped together. The area under the ROC curve was 0.89. Functional OCT of the prostate has shown to differentiate between cancer and healthy prostate tissue. The optical attenuation coefficient in malignant tissue was significantly higher in malignant tissue compared to benign prostate tissue. Further studies are required to validate these initial results in a larger group of patients with a more tailored histopathology matching protocol.},

Here, we report development of a Raman spectroscopy technique to simultaneously identify microcalcification status and diagnose the underlying breast lesion, in real-time, during stereotactic core needle biopsy procedures. Raman spectra were obtained ex vivo from 146 tissue sites from fresh stereotactic breast needle biopsy tissue cores from 33 patients, including 50 normal tissue sites, 77 lesions with microcalcifications, and 19 lesions without microcalcifications, using a compact clinical system. The Raman spectra were modeled on the basis of the breast tissue components, and a support vector machine framework was used to develop a single-step diagnostic algorithm to distinguish normal tissue, fibrocystic change (FCC), fibroadenoma, and breast cancer, in the absence and presence of microcalcifications. This algorithm was subjected to leave-one-site-out cross-validation, yielding a positive predictive value, negative predictive value, sensitivity, and specificity of 100%, 95.6%, 62.5%, and 100% for diagnosis of breast cancer (with or without microcalcifications) and an overall accuracy of 82.2% for classification into specific categories of normal tissue, FCC, fibroadenoma, or breast cancer (with and without microcalcifications). Notably, the majority of breast cancers diagnosed are ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), the most common lesion associated with microcalcifications, which could not be diagnosed using previous Raman algorithm(s). Our study shows the potential of Raman spectroscopy to concomitantly detect microcalcifications and diagnose associated lesions, including DCIS, and thus provide real-time feedback to radiologists during such biopsy procedures, reducing nondiagnostic and false-negative biopsies.

The 900 μm diameter probe can detect high spectral quality Raman signals in both the fingerprint and high wavenumber spectral regions with minimal disruption to the neurosurgical workflow.

As a proof-of-concept, we also demonstrate the consistency of the acquired Raman signal with different systems and experimental settings.

The device uses multiple diffuse reflectance spectra acquired in an outward-viewing geometry to detect intravascular hemoglobin, enabling the construction of an optical image in the vicinity of the biopsy needle revealing the proximity to blood vessels. This optical detection system seamlessly integrates into a commercial biopsy system without disrupting the neurosurgical clinical workflow. Using diffusive brain tissue phantoms, we show that this device can detect 0.5-mm diameter absorptive carbon rods up to ∼2  mm from the biopsy window. We also demonstrate feasibility and practicality of the technique in a clinical environment to detect brain vasculature in an in vivo model system.

   abstract = {Low latency is critical for many applications in wireless communications, e.g., vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V), multimedia, and industrial control networks. Meanwhile, for the capability of providing multi-gigabits per second (Gbps) rates, millimeter-wave (mm-wave) communication has attracted substantial research interest recently. This paper investigates two strategies to reduce the communication delay in future wireless networks: traffic dispersion and network densification. A hybrid scheme that combines these two strategies is also considered. The probabilistic delay and effective capacity are used to evaluate performance. For probabilistic delay, the violation probability of delay, i.e., the probability that the delay exceeds a given tolerance level, is characterized in terms of upper bounds, which are derived by applying stochastic network calculus theory. In addition, to characterize the maximum affordable arrival traffic for mm-wave systems, the effective capacity, i.e., the service capability with a given quality-of-service (QoS) requirement, is studied. The derived bounds on the probabilistic delay and effective capacity are validated through simulations. These numerical results show that, for a given sum power budget, traffic dispersion, network densification, and the hybrid scheme exhibit different potentials to reduce the end-to-end communication delay. For instance, traffic dispersion outperforms network densification when high sum power budget and arrival rate are given, while it could be the worst option, otherwise. Furthermore, it is revealed that, increasing the number of independent paths and/or relay density is always beneficial, while the performance gain is related to the arrival rate and sum power, jointly. Therefore, a proper transmission scheme should be selected to optimize the delay performance, according to the given conditions on arrival traffic and system service capability.},

   abstract = {Millimeter wave (mmWave) communication has raised increasing attentions from both academia and industry due to its exceptional advantages. Compared with existing wireless communication techniques, such as WiFi and 4G, mmWave communications adopt much higher carrier frequencies and thus come with advantages including huge bandwidth, narrow beam, high transmission quality, and strong detection ability. These advantages can well address difficult situations caused by recent popular applications using wireless technologies. For example, mmWave communications can significantly alleviate the skyrocketing traffic demand of wireless communication from video streaming. Meanwhile, mmWave communications have several natural disadvantages, e.g., severe signal attenuation, easily blocked by obstacles, and small coverage, due to its short wavelengths. Hence, the major challenge is how to overcome its shortcomings while fully utilizing its advantages. In this paper, we present a taxonomy based on the layered model and give an extensive review on mmWave communications. Specially, we divide existing efforts into four categories that investigate: Physical layer, medium access control (MAC) layer, network layer, and cross layer optimization, respectively. First, we present an overview of some technical details in physical layer. Second, we summarize available literature in MAC layer that pertains to protocols and scheduling schemes. Third, we make an in-depth survey of related research work in network layer, providing brain storming and methodology for enhancing the capacity and coverage of mmWave networks. Fourth, we analyze available research work related to cross layer allocation/optimization for mmWave communications. Fifth, we make a review of mmWave applications to illustrate how mmWave technology can be employed to satisfy other services. At the end of each section described above, we point out the inadequacy of existing work and identify the future work. Sixth, we present some available resources for mmWave communications, including related books about mmWave, commonly used mmWave frequencies, existing protocols based on mmWave, and experimental platforms. Finally, we have a simple summary and point out several promising future research directions.},

   abstract = {Triggered by the explosion of mobile traffic, 5G (5th Generation) cellular network requires evolution to increase the system rate 1000 times higher than the current systems in 10 years. Motivated by this common problem, there are several studies to integrate mm-wave access into current cellular networks as multi-band heterogeneous networks to exploit the ultra-wideband aspect of the mm-wave band. The authors of this paper have proposed comprehensive architecture of cellular networks with mm-wave access, where mm-wave small cell basestations and a conventional macro basestation are connected to Centralized-RAN (C-RAN) to effectively operate the system by enabling power efficient seamless handover as well as centralized resource control including dynamic cell structuring to match the limited coverage of mm-wave access with high traffic user locations via user-plane/control-plane splitting. In this paper, to prove the effectiveness of the proposed 5G cellular networks with mm-wave access, system level simulation is conducted by introducing an expected future traffic model, a measurement based mm-wave propagation model, and a centralized cell association algorithm by exploiting the C-RAN architecture. The numerical results show the effectiveness of the proposed network to realize 1000 times higher system rate than the current network in 10 years which is not achieved by the small cells using commonly considered 3.5 GHz band. Furthermore, the paper also gives latest status of mm-wave devices and regulations to show the feasibility of using mm-wave in the 5G systems.},

Heutzutage variieren Her-angehensweisen der Resektion und Rekonstruktion je nach Tumor und Patientin erheblich. Diese Literaturzu-sammenstellung stellt den aktuellen Wissensstand dar und diskutiert aufkommende Fragen, wie ausgedehnt die operative Therapie des Mammakarzinoms in verschiede-nen klinischen Situationen sein sollte. Die Brusterhal-tung ist beim frühen Mammakarzinom heute die Me-thode der Wahl. Die Diskussion über Resektionsgrenzen wird nach wie vor kontrovers geführt, da verschiedene Studien widersprüchliche Ergebnisse zeigen. Die modifi-ziert radikale Mastektomie ist der Standard bei der Be-handlung des fortgeschrittenen Mammakarzinoms, wobei es hier sehr vielversprechende Ansätze der weite-ren Reduzierung der Radikalität (Haut-, Areolen-und Nippelerhalt) gibt. Die Entfernung des Wächterlymph-knotens kommt beim klinisch nodal negativen, invasiven Mammakarzinom heute in vielen Situationen zum Ein-satz, wohingegen die Bedeutung der axillären Lympho-nodektomie durch eine Reihe von ähnlichen Studien-ergebnissen infrage gestellt wird.

Keywords Breast cancer surgery · Resection margins · Sentinel lymph node biopsy · Axillary lymphonodectomy Summary Surgery is still a main therapeutic option in breast cancer treatment. Nowadays, methods of resection and reconstruction vary according to different tumors and patients. This review presents and discusses standards of care and arising questions on how radical primary breast cancer surgery should be according to different clinical situations. In most early breast cancer patients, breast conservation is the method of choice. The discussion on resection margins is still controversial as different studies show conflicting results. Modified radical mastectomy is the standard in locally advanced breast cancer patients, although there are different promising approaches to spare skin or even the nipple-areola complex. A sentinel node biopsy is the standard of care in clinically node-negative invasive breast cancer patients, whereas the significance of axillary lymphonodectomy seems to be questioned through a number of different findings. Although there are interesting findings to modify surgical approaches in very young or elderly breast cancer patients, it will always be an individualized approach if we do not adhere to current guidelines. Up to date, there are no special surgical procedures in BRCA mutation carriers or patients of high-risk families.},

   abstract = {Communication at millimeter wave (mmWave) frequencies is defining a new era of wireless communication. The mmWave band offers higher bandwidth communication channels versus those presently used in commercial wireless systems. The applications of mmWave are immense: wireless local and personal area networks in the unlicensed band, 5G cellular systems, not to mention vehicular area networks, ad hoc networks, and wearables. Signal processing is critical for enabling the next generation of mmWave communication. Due to the use of large antenna arrays at the transmitter and receiver, combined with radio frequency and mixed signal power constraints, new multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communication signal processing techniques are needed. Because of the wide bandwidths, low complexity transceiver algorithms become important. There are opportunities to exploit techniques like compressed sensing for channel estimation and beamforming. This article provides an overview of signal processing challenges in mmWave wireless systems, with an emphasis on those faced by using MIMO communication at higher carrier frequencies.},

   abstract = {This paper presents the first multiband mm-wave linear Doherty PA in silicon for broadband 5G applications. We introduce a new transformer-based on-chip Doherty power combiner, which can reduce the impedance transformation ratio in power back-off (PBO) and thus improve the bandwidth and power-combining efficiency. We also devise a "driver-PA co-design" method, which creates power-dependent uneven feeding in the Doherty PA and enhances the Doherty operation without any hardware overhead or bandwidth compromise. For the proof of concept, we implement a 28/37/39-GHz PA fully integrated in a standard 130-nm SiGe BiCMOS process, which occupies 1.8mm 2. The PA achieves a 52% −3-dB small-signal S21 bandwidth and a 40% −1-dB large-signal saturated output power (Psat) bandwidth. At 28/37/39GHz, the PA achieves +16.8/+17.1/+17-dBm Psat, +15.2/+15.5/+15.4-dBm P1dB, and superior 1.72/1.92/1.62 times efficiency enhancement over class-B operation at 5.9/6/6.7-dB PBO. Moreover, the PA demonstrates multi-Gb/s data rates with excellent efficiency and linearity for 64QAM in all the three 5G bands. This PA advances the state of the art for Doherty, wideband, and 5G silicon PAs in mm-wave bands. It supports drop-in upgrade for current PAs in existing mm-wave systems and opens doors to compact system solutions for future multiband 5G massive MIMO and phased-array platforms.},

First, the mathematic model of signal detection in frequency domain is formed as a compressive sensing (CS) problem. Based on this model, a novel detector, which exploits the unique group sparsity of the signal, is proposed to improve the accuracy of the nonzero elements localization. On the basis of the channel matrix decomposition, the detector combines the CS algorithms and the iteration process together to overcome the performance deterioration brought by inter-carrier interference. Moreover, theoretical analysis about the performance gain guarantee of our proposed detector is conducted and the complexity of the proposed detector is compared with the related works. Furthermore, we also extend our proposed detector into the special scenario that the train passes the overlapped area of the adjacent two cells and receives the superimposed signal. In order to deal with the inter-cell interference, a generalized SM framework is adopted to model the signal detection. Simulation results verify that the proposed detectors have an apparent performance gain compared to the conventional CS schemes with the same complexity order.},

A 400 Mega-chip-per-second sliding correlator channel sounder and 24.5 dBi steerable horn antennas were used to emulate future mobile devices with adaptive antennas that will likely be used in future millimeter wave cellular systems [1]. Measurements in and around buildings show that outdoor building materials are excellent reflectors with the largest measured reflection coefficient of 0.896 for tinted glass as compared to indoor building materials that are less reflective. We also found that penetration loss is dependent not only on the number of obstructions and distance between transmitter and receiver, but also on the surrounding environment.

   abstract = {Purpose-The purpose of this paper is to develop conceptual knowledge and skills in making financial policy decisions in a rapidly growing and profitable enterprise. Design/methodology/approach-This teaching case was written by documenting and analyzing published information available to the public about Apple. It presents Apple's situation at the end of April 2012. The company reported net profits of US$11.6 billion and income from sales of US$39.186 billion both for the January-March 2012 quarter. Given this highly successful situation, students should assume the role of the company's chief financial officer, Peter Oppenheimer, and make recommendations to the board of directors about what to do with what appears to be a huge cash surplus that the company has accumulated through the years. Findings-Students/participants are usually surprised by the fact that accumulating excess cash could become a problem for any company. Through several discussions of the case the authors have found that answers to this central dilemma depend on students/participants' experiences. Executive education participants try to maintain the cash and find possible investments, while the less experienced (MBA students) worry about the negative effects of the excess liquidity on value creation. While the former group might be influenced by cash constraints situations frequent in Latin America, the latter group approaches the problem from a theoretical perspective. Research limitations/implications-Since the case was written using public data, therefore it does not take into account the actual opinions and actions of Apple's management team except for those reported by the press. Practical implications-The case points toward an overall discussion on conceptual topics such as dividend policies, share buybacks, and stock splits. It frames this discussion in terms of a financial strategy matrix developed by Hawawini and Viallet. According to this matrix, the company is creating value with excess liquidity, and this context helps practitioners to determine the optimal solution and provides executives with a clear guideline. The management's problem, in this case, is to find ways to invest surplus liquidity productively, or failing that, to define the best way to return it to shareholders. Originality/value-This teaching case provides students and practitioners with a practical application of the Hawawini and Viallet framework to the solution of the financial problem faced by successful companies like Apple. Moreover, it shares the teaching experiences of the authors in both MBA and executive education programs.},

As such, we move beyond an exclusive focus on what makes Apple unique or different by evaluating the mundane and out-dated elements of its business model. To do so, we examine the end-to-end supply chain, from source to store, to present a more holistic evaluation of the Apple business model. Drawing on the existing literature, we argue that the quintessential element of the Apple business model is its ability to 'own the consumer'. In short, the Apple business model is designed to drive consumers into its ecosystem and then hold them there, which has been hugely successful to date and has allowed Apple to wield enormous power in the end-to-end supply chain. We demonstrate this through a detailed evaluation of Apple's physical and content supply chains and its retailing strategy. Moreover, we find that the very business processes that enable unparalleled corporate control bring with them new problems that Apple has thus far been unable, or unwilling, to adequately address. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

   abstract = {Extending Teece's landmark 1986 article, we consider how innovators benefit from value appropriation and creation. We elaborate on value appropriation, first by pointing out the importance of "industry architectures", i.e. sector-wide templates that circumscribe the division of labor; and second, by treating complementarity and factor mobility as distinctive components of co-specialization. This allows us to qualify Teece's prediction, by positing that firms can create an "architectural advantage" in terms of high levels of value appropriation without the need to engage in vertical integration. Such architectural advantage comes about when firms can enhance both complementarity and mobility in parts of the value chain where they are not active. We then elaborate on value creation by indicating how actors can benefit from investing in assets that appreciate because of innovation, which suggests that firms can benefit from encouraging imitation while investing in complementary assets.

   abstract = {Firms competing in new product categories face great technical and market uncertainty as they try to move from early adopters to mainstream markets (Mahajan and Muller, 1998; Muller and Yogev, 2006; Rogers, 2003). While the management literature identified several factors that may contribute to adoption, the role of specific product models has been understudied. To address this gap, we studied portable digital music players (MP3 players) from 1987-2006 and tested the role of specific product models in market takeoff, convergence and product category evolution. We introduced the concept of beacon product, defined as a specific product model that has great appeal to customers and sends a strong signal about what they want. We found that Apple's first iPod model triggered market takeoff and that many competitors tried to emulate the original iPod design, leading to convergence around its key design features. But it took the iPod/iTunes store combination, a new ecosystem for the legal download of digital music, to bridge the gap between early MP3 adopters, primarily young people, to mainstream markets. The iPod/iTunes ecosystem proved more difficult for competitors to copy and many of the firms that had pioneered the MP3 category exited the industry or were relegated to small niches. By subsequently introducing new models with smaller form factors at lower prices and expanding iTunes Store offerings, Apple effectively preempted competitors from gaining share in this growing market.},

In view of that, many academics and managers are trying to find a systematic framework for a strategic innovative business model. One of the examples of a systematic framework is Blue Ocean Strategy (BOS), which provides various tools for managers to find a gap in an existing market or to create a new market where there is no competition. This chapter uses Apple's iPod product chain to illustrate how BOS tools can be used to create an innovative strategy for two reasons. Firstly, there are few practical examples that illustrate the BOS, as it is a recent business model and so this chapter can be a useful illustration for those audiences who are interested in strategic innovations focusing on disruption. Secondly, the iPod is a great example of an innovative product where the manufacturer benefits from low competition, high market share, and high profit return. © 2012, IGI Global.},

A group of market pioneers, including new startups and large early pioneers focusing on hardware-centric product innovations, failed to survive and earn high performance in the new market. In contrast, a late entrant, Apple, with game-changing business model innovations, has dominated the new product market.

Objective: To examine the efficacy and oncologic safety of a systematic neurovascular structure-adjacent frozen-section examination (NeuroSAFE) during NS radical prosta-tectomy (RP). Design, setting, and participants: From January 2002 to June 2011, 11 069 consecutive RPs were performed at the University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf. Of these, 5392 (49%) were conducted with NeuroSAFE. Surgical procedure: Our NeuroSAFE approach included the whole laterorectal circumference of the prostate to determine the SM status of the complete neurovascular tissue-corresponding prostatic surface. Outcome measurements and statistical analysis: The impact of NeuroSAFE on NS frequency, SM status, and biochemical recurrence (BCR) was analyzed by chi-square test, and by Kaplan-Meier analyses in propensity score-based matched cohorts. Results and limitations: Positive SMs (PSMs) were detected in 1368 (25%) NeuroSAFE RPs, leading to a secondary resection of the ipsilateral neurovascular tissue. Secondary wide resection resulted in conversion to a definitive negative SM (NSM) status in 1180 (86%) patients. In NeuroSAFE RPs, frequency of NS was significantly higher (all stages: 97% vs 81%; pT2: 99% vs 92%; pT3a: 94% vs 72%; pT3b: 88% vs 40%; p < 0.0001) and PSM rates were significantly lower (all stages: 15% vs 22%; pT2: 7% vs 12%; pT3a: 21% vs 32%; p < 0.0001) than in the matched non-NeuroSAFE RPs. In propensity score-based comparisons , NeuroSAFE had no negative impact on BCR (pT2, p = 0.06; pT3a, p = 0.17, pT3b, p = 0.99), and BCR-free survival of patients with conversion to NSM did not differ significantly from patients with primarily NSM (pT2, p = 0.16; pT3, p = 0.26).},

   abstract = {In early-stage breast cancer, the primary treatment option for most women is breast-conserving surgery (BCS). There is a clear need for more accurate techniques to assess resection margins intraopera-tively, because on average 20% of patients require further surgery to achieve clear margins. Cerenkov luminescence imaging (CLI) combines optical and molecular imaging by detecting light emitted by 18 F-FDG. Its high-resolution and small size imaging equipment make CLI a promising technology for intraoperative margin assessment. A first-inhuman study was conducted to evaluate the feasibility of 18 F-FDG CLI for intraoperative assessment of tumor margins in BCS. Methods: Twenty-two patients with invasive breast cancer received 18 F-FDG (5 MBq/kg) 45-60 min before surgery. Sentinel lymph node biopsy was performed using an increased 99m Tc-nanocolloid activity of 150 MBq to facilitate nodal detection against the g-probe background signal (cross-talk) from 18 F-FDG. The cross-talk and 99m Tc dose required was evaluated in 2 lead-in studies. Immediately after excision, specimens were imaged intraoperatively in an investi-gational CLI system. The first 10 patients were used to optimize the imaging protocol; the remaining 12 patients were included in the analysis dataset. Cerenkov luminescence images from incised BCS specimens were analyzed postoperatively by 2 surgeons blinded to the histopathology results, and mean radiance and margin distance were measured. The agreement between margin distance on CLI and his-topathology was assessed. Radiation doses to staff were measured. Results: Ten of the 12 patients had an elevated tumor radiance on CLI. Mean radiance and tumor-to-background ratio were 560 6 160 photons/s/cm 2 /sr and 2.41 6 0.54, respectively. All 15 assessable margins were clear on CLI and histopathology. The agreement in margin distance and interrater agreement was good (k 5 0.81 and 0.912, respectively). Sentinel lymph nodes were successfully detected in all patients. The radiation dose to staff was low; surgeons received a mean dose of 34 6 15 mSv per procedure. Conclusion: Intraoper-ative 18 F-FDG CLI is a promising, low-risk technique for intraoperative assessment of tumor margins in BCS. A randomized controlled trial will evaluate the impact of this technique on reexcision rates.},

   abstract = {Optical image-guided cancer surgery is a promising technique to adequately determine tumor margins by tumor-specific targeting, potentially resulting in complete resection of tumor tissue with improved survival. However, identification of the photons coming from the fluorescent contrast agent is complicated by autofluorescence, optical tissue properties, and accurate fluorescent targeting agents and imaging systems. All these factors have an important influence on the image that is presented to the surgeon. Considering the clinical consequences at stake, it is a prerequisite to answer the questions that are essential for the surgeon. What is optical image-guided surgery and how can it improve patient care? What should the oncologic surgeon know about the fundamental principles of optical imaging to understand which conclusions can be drawn from the images? And how do the limitations influence clinical decision making? This article discusses these questions and provides a clear overview of the basic principles and practical applications. Although there are limitations to the intrinsic capacity of the technique, when practical and technical surgical possibilities are considered, optical imaging can be a very powerful intraoperative tool in guiding the future oncologic surgeon toward radical resection and optimal clinical results.},

   abstract = {Background: The objective of this population-based study was to assess patient, physician and tumour determinants associated with positive surgical margins after prostatectomy, and to assess the effects of positive surgical margins on prostate cancer-specific survival. Methods: We included 1'254 prostate cancer patients recorded at the Geneva Cancer Registry who had radical prostatectomy during 1990-2008. To assess factors associated with positive margins, we used logistic regression. We assessed the effects of positive margins on prostate cancer-specific survival by Cox proportional hazard models accounting for numerous other prognostics factors including prostate and tumour volume, the total percentage of tumour, radiotherapy, surgical approach and surgeon's caseload. Results: Among men undergoing prostatectomy, 479 (38%) had positive margins. In the multivariate logistic regression analysis, period, clinical-and pathological T stage, Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) level, Gleason score and percentage of tumour in the prostate were significantly associated to positive margins. Ten-year prostate cancer-specific survival was 96.6% for the negative margins group and 92.0% for the positive margins group (log rank p = 0.008). In the Cox survival analysis adjusted for tumour characteristics, surgical margin status per se was not an independent prognostic factor while age, pathological T, PSA level and Gleason score remained associated with prostate cancer-specific survival. Conclusions: More aggressive tumour characteristics were strong determinants for positive margins. Furthermore, surgical margin status per se was not an independent prognostic factor for prostate cancer-specific survival after adjusting by the gravity of the disease in the multivariate analysis.},

   abstract = {Background Cancer is a leading cause of death and disability globally. While surgery remains a vital part of cancer management, access to surgical care remains inconsistent. Our objective was to estimate the global need for cancer-related surgery and to identify disparities in the surgeon workforce. Methods The World Health Organization International Agency for Research on Cancer and the Global Cancer Observatory were queried for estimates on national incidences of 35 different malignancies. The proportion of patients requiring surgery for each of these cancers was extrapolated from the United States Surveillance, Epidemiology and End-Result database. The number of people requiring cancer surgery in each country was calculated and compared with the surgical workforce. Estimates were presented as choropleth maps. Associations were tested with country development indicators. Results An estimated 9,464,214 (95% CI 4,364,196-14,564,230) patients required cancer-related surgical care in 2018. An overall 1.24 people needed cancer surgery per 1000 population. This was related to income status (p \ 0.01) and Human Development Index (r = 0.86, p \ 0.001), with the largest need being in high-income countries. The number of people requiring cancer surgery per surgeon (CP-S ratio) ranged from 7.3 in the European region to 80 in the African regions. The CP-S ratio was 10 times higher for low-versus high-income countries (p \ 0.001) and was inversely related to healthcare expenditure (r =-0.59, p \ 0.001). Conclusions An estimated 9.5 million people required cancer surgery globally. Low-and middle-income countries experience a severe and acute shortage of surgeons to provide for the cancer surgery needs of the population.},

   abstract = {IMPORTANCE Contrary to practice guidelines, breastmagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is commonly used in the preoperative evaluation of women with breast cancer. While existing literature has found little benefit to MRI in most patients, potential downstream consequences associated with breast MRI are not well described. OBJECTIVE To describe patterns of preoperative breast MRI utilization in a health care system with universal insurance and its association with downstream investigations and clinical outcomes. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Thiswas a population-based retrospective cohort study using administrative heath care databases in Ontario, Canada (2012 population, 13.5 million) over 14 geographic regions were evaluated within the data set. Participants comprised 53 015 patients with primary operable breast cancer treated from 2003 to 2012. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Use of preoperative breast MRI by year, geographic region, and breast cancer stage. Postdiagnosis imaging, biopsy, and short-term surgical outcomes were also evaluated between those who did and did not receive MRI. RESULTS Overall, 14.8%of patients (7824 of 53 015) had a preoperative MRI. During the 10-year study period, MRI use increased across all stages by 8-fold (from 3%to 24%; P < .001 for trend). Factors associated with MRI use were younger age, higher socioeconomic status, higher Charlson comorbidity score, surgery performed in a teaching hospital, and fewer years of surgeon experience. Multivariate analyses showed that preoperative breast MRI was associated with higher likelihood of the following: postdiagnosis breast imaging (odds ratio [OR], 2.09; 95%CI, 1.92-2.28), postdiagnosis breast biopsies (OR, 1.74; 95%CI, 1.57-1.93), postdiagnosis imaging to assess for distant metastatic disease (OR, 1.51; 95%CI, 1.42-1.61), mastectomy (OR, 1.73; 95%CI, 1.62-1.85), contralateral prophylactic mastectomy (OR, 1.48; 95%CI, 1.23-1.77), and a greater than 30-day wait to surgery (OR, 2.52; 95%CI, 2.36-2.70) (all ORs are adjusted). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Preoperative breast MRI use has increased substantially in routine clinical practice and is associated with a significant increase in ancillary investigations, wait time to surgery, mastectomies, and contralateral prophylactic mastectomies.},

Patients and methods: A total of 103 consecutive patients with newly diagnosed operable breast cancer with tumors ≥2 cm were independently examined preoperatively with conventional assessment (mammography, breast/axillary ultrasound, chest X-ray and blood samples) and PET/CT with no prior knowledge of the other. Results: PET/CT identified a primary tumor in all but three patients (97%). PET/CT solely detected distant metastases (ovary, bones and lung) in 6 patients and new primary cancers (ovary, lung) in another two patients, as well as 12 cases of extra-axillary lymph node involvement. In 15 patients (15%), extra-axillary malignancy was detected by PET/CT only, leading to an upgrade of initial staging in 14% (14/103) and ultimately a modification of planned treatment in 8% (8/103) of patients. Conclusions: PET/CT is a valuable tool to provide information on extra-axillary lymph node involvement, distant metastases and other occult primary cancers.

Diagnosis and treatment using precision medicine is expected to be an effective method for preventing the initiation and progression of cancer. Although anatomical and functional imaging techniques such as radiography, computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET) have played an important role for accurate preoperative diagnostics, for the most part these techniques cannot be applied intraoperatively. Optical molecular imaging is a promising technique that provides a high degree of sensitivity and specificity in tumor margin detection. Furthermore, existing clinical applications have proven that optical molecular imaging is a powerful intraoperative tool for guiding surgeons performing precision procedures, thus enabling radical resection and improved survival rates. However, detection depth limitation exists in optical molecular imaging methods and further breakthroughs from optical to multi-modality intraoperative imaging methods are needed to develop more extensive and comprehensive intraoperative applications. Here, we review the current intraoperative optical molecular imaging technologies, focusing on contrast agents and surgical navigation systems, and then discuss the future prospects of multi-modality imaging technology for intraoperative imaging-guided cancer surgery.},

For solid tumors in particular, novel molecular enhancers for imaging modalities such as US, CT, MRI and PET may facilitate earlier and more accurate diagnosis and staging which are prerequisites for successful surgical therapy. Enzymatically activatable "smart" molecular MRI probes seem particularly promising because of their potential to image tumors before and after surgical removal without re-administration of the probe to evaluate completeness of surgical resection. Furthermore, the use of "smart" MR probes as part of screening programs may enable detection of small tumors throughout the body in at-risk patient populations. Dual labeling of molecular MR probes with fluorescent dyes can add real time intraoperative guidance facilitating complete tumor resection and preservation of important structures.

Over the last few decades, the field of breast cancer surgery has been striving for a more rational approach, directing its efforts towards removing the tumor entirely yet sparing tissue and structures not infiltrated by tumor cells. Further progress in objectivity and optimization of breast cancer excision is possible if we make the tumor and surrounding tissue visible and measurable in real time, during the course of the operation; IOUS seems to be the optimal solution to this complex requirement. IOUS was introduced into clinical practice as a device for visualization of non-palpable tumors, and compared to wire-guided localization (WGL), IOUS was always at least a viable, or much better alternative, in terms of both precision in identification and resection and for patients' and surgeons' comfort. In recent years, intraoperative ultrasound has been used in the surgery of palpable tumors to optimize resection procedures and overcome the disadvantages of classic palpation guided surgery.},

Here we describe a portable, quantitative, optical fiber probe-based, spectroscopic tissue scanner designed for intraoperative diagnostic imaging of surgical margins, which we tested in a proof of concept study in human tissue for breast cancer diagnosis. The tissue scanner combines both diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) and intrinsic fluorescence spectroscopy (IFS), and has hyperspectral imaging capability, acquiring full DRS and IFS spectra for each scanned image pixel. Modeling of the DRS and IFS spectra yields quantitative parameters that reflect the metabolic, biochemical and morphological state of tissue, which are translated into disease diagnosis. The tissue scanner has high spatial resolution (0.25 mm) over a wide field of view (10 cm610 cm), and both high spectral resolution (2 nm) and high spectral contrast, readily distinguishing tissues with widely varying optical properties (bone, skeletal muscle, fat and connective tissue). Tissue-simulating phantom experiments confirm that the tissue scanner can quantitatively measure spectral parameters, such as hemoglobin concentration, in a physiologically relevant range with a high degree of accuracy (,5% error). Finally, studies using human breast tissues showed that the tissue scanner can detect small foci of breast cancer in a background of normal breast tissue. This tissue scanner is simpler in design, images a larger field of view at higher resolution and provides a more physically meaningful tissue diagnosis than other spectroscopic imaging systems currently reported in literatures. We believe this spectroscopic tissue scanner can provide real-time, comprehensive diagnostic imaging of surgical margins in excised tissues, overcoming the sampling limitation in current histopathology margin assessment. As such it is a significant step in the development of a platform technology for intraoperative management of cancer, a clinical problem that has been inadequately addressed to date.},

Intraoperative pathologic diagnostic methods, such as frozen section analysis and imprint cytology, have been recognized as crucial tools in BCS. However, the complexity and time-consuming nature of these pathologic procedures still inhibit their broader applicability worldwide. To address this situation, two issues should be considered: 1) the development of nonpathologic intraoperative diagnosis methods that have better sensitivity, specificity, speed, and cost; and 2) the promotion of new imaging algorithms to standardize data for analyzing positive margins, as represented by artificial intelligence (AI), without the need for judgment by well-trained pathologists. Researchers have attempted to develop new methods or techniques; several have recently emerged for real-time intraoperative management of breast margins in live tissues. These methods include conventional imaging, spectroscopy, tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, microscopy, fluorescent probes, and multimodal imaging techniques. This work summarizes the traditional pathologic and newly developed techniques and discusses the advantages and disadvantages of each method. Taking into consideration the recent advances in analyzing pathologic data from breast cancer tissue with AI, the combined use of new technologies with AI algorithms is proposed, and future directions for real-time intraoperative margin assessment in BCS are discussed.},

   abstract = {Background: Frozen-section analysis (FS) of the sentinel lymph node (SLN) is performed to avoid reoperation for axillary lymph node dissection (ALND), but it can miss micrometastatic disease, is labor intensive for the pathologist, and does not alter the number of breast-conservation therapy (BCT) patients needing reoperation for positive margins. The purpose of this study was to determine if eliminating FS would change reoperation rates in BCT patients. Study Design: Between January 2004 and December 2005, 1,218 patients had simultaneous BCT and SLN biopsy for invasive breast cancer. FS of the SLN was used selectively at the surgeon's discretion. Clinical and pathologic data were collected. Results: Overall, 542 of 1,218 (44%) patients had positive margins. FS of the SLN was performed in 931 of 1,218 (76%) patients. In those having FS, the SLN positivity rate was 33% (306 of 931). FS identified the positive SLN in 170 of 306 (56%) patients with positive nodes, allowing for immediate ALND. But 101 of these 170 patients had positive lumpectomy margins; and FS of the SLN saved 69 of 931 (7%) patients a second operation. Of patients not having FS, 48 of 287 (17%) had a positive SLN on final pathology. Only 18 of 48 (those seen on routine hematoxylin and eosin) might have been seen on FS, potentially sparing reoperation. Half of patients not having FS required reexcision for positive margins. FS would have spared reoperation for only 8 of 287 (3%) patients in this group. Overall, of 354 of 1,218 patients with SLN metastases, 170 had immediate ALND and 98 had delayed ALND. Of those having delayed ALND, 68 of 98 also had positive margins. Conclusions: Among patients having BCT with SLN biopsy, FS identified the positive SLN in 56% of patients with positive SLNs, allowing immediate ALND, and was false negative in 44%. Margin status remains a frequent indication for reoperation in BCT; routine FS analysis of the SLN ultimately saves only a minority of patients a second operation. © 2008 American College of Surgeons.},

   abstract = {Introduction: Reoperation after breast-conserving surgery (BCS) could be proposed for positive or close margins. Reoperation type, re-excision or mastectomy, depends on several factors in relation to patient's and tumor's characteristics. We have analyzed our breast cancer (BC) database in order to determine second and third attempts for BCS and mastectomy rates, as well as associated factors for type of surgery. Methods: All patients with BCS between 1995 and 2017 were included. Patient's characteristics , pathologic results, and treatments were analyzed. Reoperation rate, type of reoperation, second reoperation, and associated factors of reoperation, mastectomy, and third intervention were determined. Three periods were determined: P1-P3. Results: We analyzed 10,761 patients: 1,161 with ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) and 9,600 with invasive BC. The reoperation rate was 41.4% for DCIS and 28.0% for invasive BC. Using multivariate analysis, we identified tumor size >20 mm as being a risk factor for reoperation, whereas age >50 years, P2-3, and some localization decreased reoperation rates. For invasive BC, age >40 years, triple-negative tumors, neoadjuvant chemotherapy, and noncentral tumors decreased reoperation rates and lobular tumor, multifocal tumors, lymphovascular invasion, DCIS component, and Her2-positive tumors increased reoperation rates. For patients requiring reoperation, re-excision was performed in 48.1% (1,523/3,168) and mastectomy was required after first re-excision in 13.46% (205/1,523). For DCIS, mastectomy rates were higher for grade 2 and tumor ≥20 mm. For invasive BC, mastectomy rates were higher for lobular, multifocal, ≥20 mm, Her2-positive tumors and diffuse positive margins and lower for age >50 years and during the last period. Even if interval time between surgery and adjuvant treatments was higher for patients with reoperation, survival rates were not different between patients with and without reoperation. Conclusion: A decrease in reoperation and mastectomy rates had been reported with several associated factors. A third intervention with mastectomy was required in 13.5% of patients. This information should be done in case of reoperation.},

In this contribution, a feasibility study of in vivo radiopharmaceutical imaging in heterogeneous medium is presented. Coupled with a multimodal in vivo imaging system, this CLT reconstruction method allows precise anatomical registration of the positron probe in heterogeneous tissues and facilitates the more widespread application of radiotracers.

When Cerenkov luminescence data are collected, the high-energy particles from the radioactive nucleus will be detected by the sensitive CCD camera and lead to impulse noise. To suppress the impulse noise and improve the contrast of the useful signal to the background, the detection-based fuzzy switching median filtering framework is proposed in this paper. Several experiments were conducted respectively to investigate the statistical feature of the noise and to evaluate the performance of the proposed noise removal framework. The results show that the signal-to-noise ratio is improved after noise elimination. The proposed filtering framework outperforms the classical median filter in terms of root mean squared error and the structural similarity index. It also preserves the maximum value and the mean value in the regions of interest better than the median filter does. In addition, compared with the FLICMCDD algorithm, the proposed method works much faster while getting similar results.},

   abstract = {Objective: Surgical complications may affect patients psychologically due to challenges such as prolonged recovery or long-lasting disability. Psychological distress could further delay patients' recovery as stress delays wound healing and compromises immunity. This review investigates whether surgical complications adversely affect patients' postoperative well-being and the duration of this impact. Methods: The primary data sources were 'PsychINFO', 'EMBASE' and 'MEDLINE' through OvidSP (year 2000 to May 2012). The reference lists of eligible articles were also reviewed. Studies were eligible if they measured the association of complications after major surgery from 4 surgical specialties (ie, cardiac, thoracic, gastrointestinal and vascular) with adult patients' postoperative psychosocial outcomes using validated tools or psychological assessment. 13 605 articles were identified. 2 researchers independently extracted information from the included articles on study aims, participants' characteristics, study design, surgical procedures, surgical complications, psychosocial outcomes and findings. The studies were synthesised narratively (ie, using text). Supplementary meta-analyses of the impact of surgical complications on psychosocial outcomes were also conducted. Results: 50 studies were included in the narrative synthesis. Two-thirds of the studies found that patients who suffered surgical complications had significantly worse postoperative psychosocial outcomes even after controlling for preoperative psychosocial outcomes, clinical and demographic factors. Half of the studies with significant findings reported significant adverse effects of complications on patient psychosocial outcomes at 12 months (or more) postsurgery. 3 supplementary meta-analyses were completed, 1 on anxiety (including 2 studies) and 2 on physical and mental quality of life (including 3 studies). The latter indicated statistically significantly lower physical and mental quality of life (p<0.001) for patients who suffered surgical complications. Conclusions: Surgical complications appear to be a significant and often long-term predictor of patient postoperative psychosocial outcomes. The results highlight the importance of attending to patients' psychological needs in the aftermath of surgical complications.},

The goal of this study was to review the world's literature on postoperative complications in general surgery patients and try to examine the effect of these complications on patient-centered outcomes. Methods: A comprehensive search of the current literature identified 18 studies on the topic of postoperative complications in general surgery patients. Results: Postoperative complications are common in general surgery patients and contribute to increased mortality, length of stay, and need for an increased level of care at discharge (decline in disposition). Conclusions: Although the concept of patient-centered outcomes is not new, it has not been applied to postoperative complications. It is likely that the effect of complications on length of hospital stay and postoperative discharge reflects an impact of complications on these patient-centered outcomes. Future studies should consider the effect of complications on those outcomes that are most important to the individual patient. © 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {Tumor-free surgical margins are critical in breast-conserving surgery. In up to 38% of the cases, however, patients undergo a second surgery since malignant cells are found at the margins of the excised resection specimen. Thus, advanced imaging tools are needed to ensure clear margins at the time of surgery. The objective of this study was to evaluate a random forest classifier that makes use of parameters derived from point-scanning label-free fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIm) measurements of breast specimens as a means to diagnose tumor at the resection margins and to enable an intuitive visualization of a probabilistic classifier on tissue specimen. FLIm data from fresh lumpectomy and mastectomy specimens from 18 patients were used in this study. The supervised training was based on a previously developed registration technique between autofluorescence imaging data and cross-sectional histology slides. A pathologist's histology annotations provide the ground truth to distinguish between adipose, fibrous, and tumor tissue. Current results demonstrate the ability of this approach to classify the tumor with 89% sensitivity and 93% specificity and to rapidly (∼ 20 frames per second) overlay the probabilistic classifier overlaid on excised breast specimens using an intuitive color scheme. Furthermore, we show an iterative imaging refinement that allows surgeons to switch between rapid scans with a customized, low spatial resolution to quickly cover the specimen and slower scans with enhanced resolution (400 µm per point measurement) in suspicious regions where more details are required. In summary, this technique provides high diagnostic prediction accuracy, rapid acquisition, adaptive resolution, nondestructive probing, and facile interpretation of images, thus holding potential for clinical breast imaging based on label-free FLIm.},

   abstract = {In this paper, we showed that Cerenkov radiation (CR) escaping from the surface of small living animals injected with 18 F-FDG can be detected with optical imaging techniques. 18 F decays by emitting positrons with a maximum energy of 0.635 MeV; such positrons, when travelling into tissues faster than the speed of light in the same medium, are responsible of CR emission. A detailed model of the CR spectrum considering the positron energy spectrum was developed in order to quantify the amount of light emission. The results presented in this work were obtained using a commercial optical imager equipped with charged coupled detectors (CCD). Our data open the door to optical imaging (OI) in vivo of the glucose metabolism, at least in pre-clinical research. We found that the heart and bladder can be clearly identified in the animal body reflecting the accumulation of the 18 F-FDG. Moreover, we describe two different methods based on the spectral analysis of the CR that can be used to estimate the depth of the source inside the animal. We conclude that 18 F-FDG can be employed as it is as a bimodal tracer for positron emission tomography (PET) and OI techniques. Our results are encouraging, suggesting that it could be possible to apply the proposed approach not only to β + but also to pure β − emitters.},

   abstract = {It has been observed that microfluidic chips used for synthesizing 18F-labeled compounds demonstrate visible light emission without nearby scintillators or fluorescent materials. The origin of the light was investigated and found to be consistent with the emission characteristics from Cerenkov radiation. Since 18F decays through the emission of high-energy positrons, the energy threshold for beta particles, i.e. electrons or positrons, to generate Cerenkov radiation was calculated for water and polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), the most commonly used polymer-based material for microfluidic chips. Beta particles emitted from 18F have a continuous energy spectrum, with a maximum energy that exceeds this energy threshold for both water and PDMS. In addition, the spectral characteristics of the emitted light from 18F in distilled water were also measured, yielding a broad distribution from 300 nm to 700 nm, with higher intensity at shorter wavelengths. A photograph of the 18F solution showed a bluish-white light emitted from the solution, further suggesting Cerenkov radiation. In this study, the feasibility of using this Cerenkov light emission as a method for quantitative measurements of the radioactivity within the microfluidic chip in situ was evaluated. A detector previously developed for imaging microfluidic platforms was used. The detector consisted of a charge-coupled device (CCD) optically coupled to a lens. The system spatial resolution, minimum detectable activity and dynamic range were evaluated. In addition, the calibration of a Cerenkov signal versus activity concentration in the microfluidic chip was determined. This novel method of Cerenkov radiation measurements will provide researchers with a simple yet robust quantitative imaging tool for microfluidic applications utilizing beta particles. © 2009 Institute of Physics and Engineering in Medicine.},

   abstract = {Imaging the location and extent of cancer provides invaluable information before, during, and after surgery. The majority of ''image-guided'' methods that use, for example, positron emission tomography (PET) involve preoperative imaging and do not provide real-time information during surgery. It is now well established that the inherent optical emissions (Cerenkov radiation) from various b-emitting radionuclides can be visualized by Cerenkov luminescence imaging (CLI). Here we report the full characterization of CLI using the positron-emitting radiotracer 89 Zr-DFO-trastuzumab for target-specific, quantitative imaging of HER2/neu-positive tumors in vivo. We also provide the first demonstration of the feasibility of using CLI for true image-guided, intraoperative surgical resection of tumors. Analysis of optical CLIs provided accurate, quantitative information on radiotracer biodistribution and tissue uptake that correlated well with the concordant PET images. CLI, PET, and biodistribution studies revealed target-specific uptake of 89 Zr-DFO-trastuzumab in BT-474 (HER2/neu positive) versus MDA-MB-468 (HER2/neu negative) xenografts in the same mice. Competitive inhibition (blocking) studies followed by CLI also confirmed the in vivo immunoreactivity and specificity of 89 Zr-DFO-trastuzumab for HER2/neu. Overall, these results strongly support the continued development of CLI as a preclinical and possible clinical tool for use in molecular imaging and surgical procedures for accurately defining tumor margins.},

   abstract = {Cerenkov luminescence imaging (CLI) is an emerging new molecular imaging modality that is relatively inexpensive, easy to use, and has high throughput. CLI can image clinically available PET and SPECT probes using optical instrumentation. Cerenkov luminescence endoscopy (CLE) is one of the most intriguing applications that promise potential clinical translation. We developed a prototype customized fiberscopic Cerenkov imaging system to investigate the potential in guiding minimally invasive surgical resection. Methods: All experiments were performed in a dark chamber. Cerenkov luminescence from 18F-FDG samples containing decaying radioactivity was transmitted through an optical fiber bundle and imaged by an intensified charge-coupled device camera. Phantoms filled with 18F-FDG were used to assess the imaging spatial resolution. Finally, mice bearing subcutaneous C6 glioma cells were injected intravenously with 18F-FDG to determine the feasibility of in vivo imaging. The tumor tissues were exposed, and CLI was performed on the mouse before and after surgical removal of the tumor using the fiber-based imaging system and compared with a commercial optical imaging system. Results: The sensitivity of this particular setup was approximately 45 kBq (1.21 μCi)/300 μL. The 3 smallest sets of cylindric holes in a commercial SPECT phantom were identifiable via this system, demonstrating that the system has a resolution better than 1.2 mm. Finally, the in vivo tumor imaging study demonstrated the feasibility of using CLI to guide the resection of tumor tissues. Conclusion: This proof-of-concept study explored the feasibility of using fiber-based CLE for the detection of tumor tissue in vivo for guided surgery. With further improvements of the imaging sensitivity and spatial resolution of the current system, CLE may have a significant application in the clinical setting in the near future.

   abstract = {The paper opens with a brief review of the original discovery of the radiation and the physical principles of the process that gives rise to it. This is followed by an elementary account of the theory of the effect. A general survey of the practical applications to cosmic-ray and high-energy physics is then presented, with two examples of modem detectors discussed in greater detail. The article concludes with an account of recent experiments carried-out on light pulses from the night-sky associated with cosmic-ray showers, found to be due to Cerenkov radiation in the atmosphere. H I S T O R I C A L I N T R O D U C T I O N It was observed by many workers in the early days of the study of radioactivity that a faint visible light was sometimes emitted from strong sources of ,6-and y-radiation. This light, which was bluish-white in colour, was particularly evident when the sources were in the form of a solution. It seemed natural, at the time, to attribute the radiation to ionization caused either by /%particles or secondary electrons from y-rays. However, this explanation was soon found to be unsatisfactory for a number of reasons. In the first place the colour and intensity of the light were found to be markedly independent of the medium from which it emanated; this property, and one discovered later, namely that the spectrum of the radiation was continuous, were at variance with the general properties of luminescence produced by. ionization, properties already well known at the time. It was found, furthermore, that the light could-not be quenched by the addition of impurities in the solutions, neither did its intensity depend on the temperature, two properties again in contrast to those normally found in the phenomena of luminescence. The first serious attempt to study the phenomenon on a quantitative basis appears to have been due to Mallet(1,2z3) who .describes, in three papers, results of experiments carried out with a spectrograph to try and resolve the observed continuous spectrum. Though perhaps Mallet deserves more credit for his part in the early investigations, his work was not developed on the experimental side, neither was there any attempt to explain the phenomenon theoretically. Some years later, however, and quite indepcndently, a long series of experiments were carried out by Cerenkod4) who proved conclusively that this mechanism of light production by the passage of fast charged particles through transparent media was indeed very different from lueescence. In addition to the properties already mentioned, Cerenkov discovered two other features by which the effect could be distinguished, namely that the light has unique polarization and directional properties. In view of the considerable work camed out by Cerenkov on the experimental side, the radiation has appropriately been named after him. About the Same time, Frank and Tamrd5) brought out a theory of the effect based entirely upon classical electromagnetic theory. Following these early experiments, there was a lapse of Some years during which very little work was done; since 1945 however, there have been great strides in the field. The advent of the photomultiplier, the most sensitive detector known for the study of faint pulses of light, has been largely responsible for the more recent developments. At the same},

Some graphene-like structures, for instance graphene with implanted ions, or, also 2D-glasses, are dielectric media, and it means that it enables the experimental realization of the Vavilov-ˇ Cerenkov radiation. We calculate it from the viewpoint of the Schwinger theory of sources. The fast moving charged particle in a medium when its speed is faster than the speed of light in this medium produces electromagnetic radiation which is called the Vavilov-ˇ Cerenkov radiation. The prediction of Cerenkov radiation came long ago. Heaviside (1889) investigated the possibility of a charged object moving in a medium faster than electromagnetic waves in the same medium becomes a source of directed electromagnetic radiation. Kelvin (1901) presented an idea that the emission of particles is possible at a speed greater than that of light. Somewhat later, Sommerfeld (1904) proposed the hypothetical radiation with a sharp angular distribution. However, in fact, from experimental point of view, the electromagnetič Cerenkov radiation was first observed in the early 1900's by experiments developed by Marie and Pierre Curie when studying radioactivity emission. In essence they observed the emission of a bluish-white light from transparent substances in the neighborhood of strong radioactive source. But the first attempt to understand the origin},

   abstract = {Purpose 2-[ 18 F]Fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (18 F-FDG) is a widely used PET radiotracer for the in vivo diagnosis of several diseases such as tumours. The positrons emitted by 18 F-FDG, travelling into tissues faster than the speed of light in the same medium, are responsible for Cerenkov radiation (CR) emission which is prevalently in the visible range. The purpose of this study is to show that CR escaping from tumour tissues of small living animals injected with 18 F-FDG can be detected with optical imaging (OI) techniques using a commercial optical instrument equipped with charge-coupled detectors (CCD). Methods The theory behind the Cerenkov light emission and the source depth measurements using CR is first presented. Mice injected with 18 F-FDG or saline solution underwent dynamic OI acquisition and a comparison between images was performed. Multispectral analysis of the radiation was used to estimate the depth of the source of Cerenkov light. Small animal PET images were also acquired in order to compare the 18 F-FDG bio-distribution measured using OI and PET scanner. Results Cerenkov in vivo whole-body images of tumour-bearing mice and the measurements of the emission spectrum (560-660 nm range) are presented. Brain, kidneys and tumour were identified as a source of visible light in the animal body: the tissue time-activity curves reflected the physiological accumulation of 18 F-FDG in these organs. The identification is confirmed by the comparison between CR and 18 F-FDG images. Conclusion These results will allow the use of conventional OI devices for the in vivo study of glucose metabolism in cancer and the assessment, for example, of anti-cancer drugs. Moreover, this demonstrates that 18 F-FDG can be employed as it is a bimodal tracer for PET and OI techniques.},

Combining optical imaging instruments and most of nuclear medicine imaging or radiotherapy probes, the CR was developed as a new imaging modality for biology studies, called Cerenkov luminescence imaging (CLI). On the other hand, it was novelly used as an internal excitation source to activate some fluorophores for energy transfer imaging. However, it also has some shortages such as relatively weak luminescence intensity and low penetration in tissue. Thus some scientific groups demonstrated to optimize the CLI and demonstrated it to three-dimension tomography. In this article, we elaborate on its principle, history, and applications and discuss a number of directions for technical improvements.

   abstract = {FoR those who have worked on ~erenkov radiation it is of great interest to read that Kaiser 1 has unearthed a prediction of the effect by Heaviside that predates ~erenkov's early work by 46 years, and it is remarkable that apparently, this has not been pointed out before. It would seem, however, at least from the extract quoted by Kaiser, that Heaviside did not suggest or carry out any experiments. Indeed this was virtually impossible at that time, as his paper predates the discoveries of cosmic rays and radioactivity, and there were, of course, no beams of artificially accelerated relativistic particles available at that time. It is therefore on the theoretical side that Heaviside's work is significant and his name should thus be linked with those of Vavilov 2 and of Frank and Tamm 3 • Here I point out that, as far as the experimental side is concerned, it would seem rather that the credit should go to the French physicist Mallet, who, through his observations between 1926 and 1928 (refs. 4 to 6), was probably the first to study the effect always attributed to ~erenkov, a point already raised by myself, by Mallet himself8 and by Perrin 9 • I therefore suggest that, for those who feel that changing established names for well known phenomena is justifiable, the title Heaviside-Mallet radiation might be more appropriate than the one put forward by Kaiser. In connection with double-barrelled titles it is of interest to note that for many years the effect has also been known as Vavilov-~erenkov radiation, at least within the Soviet Union. It is not inappropriate that a French name should be associated with the effect since there is little doubt that the glow from the concentrated radioactive solutions prepared by Mme Curie 10 was generated by the same mechanism; her observations took place around 1910. This letter should not, however, be interpreted as discrediting three brilliant Nobel Prize winners, for by far the greater proportion of all theoretical work in the field has nevertheless been carried out by Russian physicists. There are sixty-two Russian references in ref. 7 alone and two other relevant sources of information, both Russian, are the treatises by Bolotovskii 11 and by Zrelov 12 • 1 Kaiser, T.

   abstract = {I still recall with great pleasure the exclamation of the greatest scientist of that epoch, Niels Bohrd"Wunderbar, Wunderschön", repeated several times after I demonstrated to him one of the most essential properties of the radiation, namely its space symmetry. Nevertheless, the atmosphere of distrust of the new effect [Cherenkov Effect] from scientific opinion remained. The most open and sharp manifestation of this distrust was the refusal by the journal Nature to publish a short paper, summarizing the essence of the phenomena and its main properties. Pavel A. Cherenkov (1986), relating his reaction to the rejection of his work by the editors of Nature and the reactions of the scientific community. (From Cherenkov, P.A., 1986. At the threshold of discovery. Nucl. Instrum. Methods Phys. Res. Sect A 248, 1e4.) 16.1 INTRODUCTION Photons of visible radiation are produced when a charged particle travels through a transparent medium at a speed greater than the speed of light in that medium. The medium may be any liquid or solid provided it is transparent. These photons are referred to as Cherenkov radiation, in honor of the Russian physicist Pavel A. Cerenkov for his basic research and discovery of the properties of this unique radiation (see Cherenkov, 1934a, 1937d). The process that gives rise to Cherenkov photons is referred to as the Cherenkov effect. In the scientific literature, four variations of the contemporary spelling or naming of Cerenkov radiation can be found, namely, (1) Cerenkov radiation, after the Russian, which is the spelling used by Pavel Cerenkov in his original papers (Cherenkov, 1934a,b, 1936, 1937aed, 1938aec); (2) Vavilove Cerenkov radiation, in honor also of Sergei Ivanovich Vavilov (1891e1951), who was the doctoral research advisor to Pavel Cerenkov during the pioneering discoveries; (3) Cherenkov radiation, which provides the English pronunciation for the Russian C; this is also the spelling used by Pavel Cherenkov (1986) in his last publication, and it is the spelling adopted by the Nobel Foundation (http://nobelprize.org/index.html); and (4) Cerenkov radiation, which is the anglicized version. All four versions of the spelling are found in the current scientific literature. Throughout this chapter, the writer will adopt the spelling Cherenkov, for the following reasons: (1) it conforms with that used by Pavel Cherenkov in his last paper (Cherenkov, 1986), entitled "At the Threshold of Discovery," which appeared in the journal Nuclear Instruments and Methods in Physics Research; (2) it is the spelling adopted by Chemical Abstracts; (3) it is the spelling adopted by the Nobel Foundation; and (4) it is the spelling adopted most often by authors of papers in the journal Nuclear Instruments and Methods in Physics Research. The Cherenkov effect and the resulting radiation produced by a charged particle traveling in a transparent medium at a velocity exceeding the speed of light in that medium were predicted theoretically as early as 1888 by Oliver Heaviside (1888, 1889, 1892, 1899, 1912a,b), but long forgotten until the radiation was discovered finally by Cherenkov (see Cherenkov, 1934a,b) and interpreted by Frank and Tamm (1937). Heaviside's early prediction was based on a traveling point charge, as the electron was not discovered by J.J. Thompson until 1897. Govorkov (2005) reviewed the historical significance of Heaviside's prediction, namely, that Heaviside first predicted theoretically that a point charge (eg, electron) would produce a conical wave front whenever it were to travel at a speed greater than the speed of light in a medium. Heaviside's prediction was before Einstein's theory of relativity, which holds that matter cannot travel faster than light in a vacuum; however, matter can travel faster than light in a medium. In the time of Heaviside, even outer space was not considered to be a vacuum but to consist of an "ether," and therefore, according to Heaviside, the conical wave front would be produced in the ether as well as any other medium provided the point charge travels at a speed exceeding that of light. In the words of Govorkov (2005): A genius, Heaviside was half a century in advance of his time in his calculations and predictions, but unfortunately he was not understood by his contemporaries. His works were forgotten, and scientists had to start from the beginning, this time from experiment [i.e., the experiments and discovery by Cherenkov (see Cherenkov 1934a,b, 1936, 1937aed, 1938aec)].

   abstract = {The lymphatic system plays a critical role in the maintenance of healthy tissues. Its function is an important indicator of the presence and extent of disease. In oncology, metastatic spread to local lymph nodes (LNs) is a strong predictor of poor outcome. Clinical methods for the visualization of LNs involve regional injection and tracking of 99mTc-sulfur colloid ( 99mTc-SC) along with absorbent dyes. Intraoperatively, these techniques suffer from the requirement of administration of multiple contrast media ( 99mTc-SC and isosulfan blue), unwieldy g-probes, and a short effective surgical window for dyes. Preclinically, imaging of transport through the lymphatics is further hindered by the resolution of lymphoscintigraphy and SPECT. We investigated multimodal imaging in animal models using intradermal administration of 18F-FDG for combined diagnostic and intraoperative use. PET visualizes LNs with high sensitivity and resolution and low background. Cerenkov radiation (CR) from 18F-FDG was evaluated to optically guide surgical resection of LNs. Methods: Imaging of 18F-FDG uptake used PET and sensitive luminescent imaging equipment (for CR). Dynamic PET was performed in both sexes and multiple strains (NCr Nude, C57BL/6, and Nu/Nu) of mice. Biodistribution confirmed the uptake of 18F-FDG and was compared with that of 99mTc-SC. Verification of uptake and the ability to use 18F-FDG CR to guide nodal removal were confirmed histologically. Results: Intradermal injection of 18F-FDG clearly revealed lymphatic vessels and LNs by PET. Dynamic imaging revealed rapid and sustained labeling of these structures. Biodistribution of the radiotracer confirmed the active transport of radioglucose in the lymphatics to the local LNs and over time into the general circulation. 18F-FDG also enabled visualization of LNs through CR, even before surgically revealing the site, and guided LN resection. Conclusion: Intradermal 18F-FDG can enhance the preclinical investigation of the lymphatics through dynamic, high-resolution, and quantitative tomographic imaging. Clinically, combined PET/Cerenkov imaging has significant potential as a single-dose, dual-modality tracer for diagnostics (PET/CT) and guided resection of LNs (Cerenkov optical).

   abstract = {Background: Cancer is set to become a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the coming decades in every region of the world. We aimed to assess the changing patterns of cancer according to varying levels of human development. Methods: We used four levels (low, medium, high, and very high) of the Human Development Index (HDI), a composite indicator of life expectancy, education, and gross domestic product per head, to highlight cancer-specific patterns in 2008 (on the basis of GLOBOCAN estimates) and trends 1988-2002 (on the basis of the series in Cancer Incidence in Five Continents), and to produce future burden scenario for 2030 according to projected demographic changes alone and trends-based changes for selected cancer sites. Findings: In the highest HDI regions in 2008, cancers of the female breast, lung, colorectum, and prostate accounted for half the overall cancer burden, whereas in medium HDI regions, cancers of the oesophagus, stomach, and liver were also common, and together these seven cancers comprised 62% of the total cancer burden in medium to very high HDI areas. In low HDI regions, cervical cancer was more common than both breast cancer and liver cancer. Nine different cancers were the most commonly diagnosed in men across 184 countries, with cancers of the prostate, lung, and liver being the most common. Breast and cervical cancers were the most common in women. In medium HDI and high HDI settings, decreases in cervical and stomach cancer incidence seem to be offset by increases in the incidence of cancers of the female breast, prostate, and colorectum. If the cancer-specific and sex-specific trends estimated in this study continue, we predict an increase in the incidence of all-cancer cases from 12·7 million new cases in 2008 to 22·2 million by 2030. Interpretation: Our findings suggest that rapid societal and economic transition in many countries means that any reductions in infection-related cancers are offset by an increasing number of new cases that are more associated with reproductive, dietary, and hormonal factors. Targeted interventions can lead to a decrease in the projected increases in cancer burden through effective primary prevention strategies, alongside the implementation of vaccination, early detection, and effective treatment programmes.

There will be an estimated 18.1 million new cancer cases (17.0 million excluding nonmelanoma skin cancer) and 9.6 million cancer deaths (9.5 million excluding nonmelanoma skin cancer) in 2018. In both sexes combined, lung cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer (11.6% of the total cases) and the leading cause of cancer death (18.4% of the total cancer deaths), closely followed by female breast cancer (11.6%), prostate cancer (7.1%), and colorectal cancer (6.1%) for incidence and colorectal cancer (9.2%), stomach cancer (8.2%), and liver cancer (8.2%) for mortality. Lung cancer is the most frequent cancer and the leading cause of cancer death among males, followed by prostate and colorectal cancer (for incidence) and liver and stomach cancer (for mortality). Among females, breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer and the leading cause of cancer death, followed by colorectal and lung cancer (for incidence), and vice versa (for mortality); cervical cancer ranks fourth for both incidence and mortality. The most frequently diagnosed cancer and the leading cause of cancer death, however, substantially vary across countries and within each country depending on the degree of economic development and associated social and life style factors. It is noteworthy that high-quality cancer registry data, the basis for planning and implementing evidence-based cancer control programs, are not available in most low- and middle-income countries.

The principal goal of PET imaging is to visualize, characterize, and measure biological processes at the cellular, subcellular, and molecular levels in living subjects using noninvasive procedures. PET imaging takes advantage of the traditional diagnostic imaging techniques and introduces positron-emitting probes to determine the expression of indicative molecular targets at different stages of cancer progression. Although [ 18F]fluorodeoxyglucose ([18F]FDG)-PET has been widely utilized for staging and restaging of cancer, evaluation of response to treatment, differentiation of post-therapy alterations from residual or recurrent tumor, and assessment of prognosis, [18F]FDG is not a target-specific PET tracer. Over the last decade, numerous target-specific PET tracers have been developed and evaluated in preclinical and clinical studies.

Cerenkov luminescence imaging (CLI) is much cheaper in terms of infrastructure than positron emission tomography (PET) and is particularly useful for imaging of superficial structures. Imaging can basically be done using a sensitive camera optimized for low-light conditions, and it has a better resolution than any other nuclear imaging modality. CLI has been shown to effectively diagnose disease with regularly used PET isotope (18F-FDG) in clinical setting. Cerenkov luminescence tomography, Cerenkov luminescence endoscopy, and intraoperative Cerenkov imaging have also been explored with positive conclusions expanding the current range of applications. Cerenkov has also been used to improve PET imaging resolution since the source of both is the radioisotope being used.

Signal-to-noise estimates show that cooled back-thinned integrating charge coupled devices (CCDs) are preferred to image-intensified CCDs for this application, mainly due to their high quantum efficiency (approximately 85%) at wavelengths >600 nm where tissue absorption is low.

The spatial resolution, the linearity of the measured signal with the activity concentration and the minimum detectable activity concentration were considered. A high linearity was observed over a broad range of activity concentration (R2⩾0.99 down to ∼40 kBq/ml of 18F-FDG). For 18F-FDG activity distributions 2 mm deep in biological tissue, the measured detection limit was 8 kBq/ml and a spatial resolution of 2.5 mm was obtained. The detection limit of the imaging system is comparable with clinical activity concentrations in tumor specimens, and the spatial resolution is compatible with clinical requirements.},

   abstract = {18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET/CT is a pivotal imaging modality for cancer imaging, assisting diagnosis, staging of patients with newly diagnosed malignancy, restaging following therapy and surveillance. Interpretation requires integration of the metabolic and anatomic findings provided by the PET and CT components which transcend the knowledge base isolated in the worlds of nuclear medicine and radiology, respectively. In the manuscript we detail our approach to reviewing and reporting a PET/CT study using the most commonly used radiotracer, FDG. This encompasses how we display, threshold intensity of images and sequence our review, which are essential for accurate interpretation. For interpretation, it is important to be aware of benign variants that demonstrate high glycolytic activity, and pathologic lesions which may not be FDG-avid, and understand the physiologic and biochemical basis of these findings. Whilst FDG PET/CT performs well in the conventional imaging paradigm of identifying, counting and measuring tumour extent, a key paradigm change is its ability to non-invasively measure glycolytic metabolism. Integrating this "metabolic signature" into interpretation enables improved accuracy and characterisation of disease providing important prognostic information that may confer a high management impact and enable better personalised patient care.},

   abstract = {Objectives: To examine whether rate of reoperation after breast conserving surgery is associated with patients' characteristics and investigate whether reoperation rates vary among English NHS trusts. Design: Cohort study using patient level data from hospital episode statistics. Setting: English NHS trusts. Participants: Adult women who had breast conserving surgery between 1 April 2005 and 31 March 2008. Main outcome measure: Reoperation rates after primary breast conserving surgery within 3 months, adjusted using logistic regression for tumour type, age, comorbidity, and socioeconomic deprivation. Tumours were grouped by whether a carcinoma in situ component was coded at the time of the primary breast conserving surgery. Results: 55 297 women had primary breast conserving surgery in 156 NHS trusts during the three year period. 11 032 (20.0%, 95% confidence interval 19.6% to 20.3%) women had at least one reoperation. 10 212 (18.5%, 18.2% to 18.8%) had one reoperation only; of these, 5943 (10.7%, 10.5% to 11.0%) had another breast conserving procedure and 4269 (7.7%, 7.5% to 7.9%) had a mastectomy. Of the 45 793 women with isolated invasive disease, 8229 (18.0%) had at least one reoperation. In comparison, 2803 (29.5%) of the 9504 women with carcinoma in situ had at least one reoperation (adjusted odds ratio 1.9, 95% confidence interval 1.8 to 2.0). Substantial differences were found in the adjusted reoperation rates among the NHS trusts (10th and 90th centiles 12.2% and 30.2%). Conclusion: One in five women who had breast conserving surgery in England had a reoperation. Reoperation was nearly twice as likely when the tumour had a carcinoma in situ component coded. Women should be informed of this reoperation risk when deciding on the type of surgical treatment of their breast cancer.},

   abstract = {Background: To assess the prognostic value of the extent of positive surgical margins (PSM) following radical prostatectomy (RP) on biochemical recurrence (BR) with long-term follow-up. Methods: This retrospective study analyzed 1275 RPs performed between January 1992 and December 2013 in two university centers in Marseille (France). The inclusion criteria were: follow-up > 24 months, undetectable postoperative prostate-specific antigen (PSA), no seminal vesicle (SV) invasion, no lymph node invasion confirmed by surgery (pN0) or imaging (pNx), and no neoadjuvant or adjuvant treatment. BR was defined by PSA level ≥ 0.2 ng/mL on two successive samples. We included 189 patients, divided into two groups: - Focal PSM (fPSM): single PSM (sPSM) ≤3 mm; - Extensive PSM (ePSM): sPSM with linear length > 3 mm or several margins regardless of the length. Results: The median follow-up was 101 months (18-283) and the median age was 63 years (46-76). BR occurred in only 12.1% (14/115) of cases involving fPSM and in 54.1% (40/74) of cases involving ePSM. In the multivariate model, ePSM patients were significantly associated with increased BR compared to fPSM (hazard ratio [HR] = 6.11; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 3.25-11.49). The ePSM significantly decreased BR-free survival (p < 0.001) for every patient and every subgroup (pT2, pT3a, pG ≤6, and pG ≥7). The median BR time following RP was significantly shorter for ePSM patients than fPSM (57.2 vs. 89.2 months p < 0.001). Conclusion: With a median 8-year follow-up, ePSM was strongly associated with BR compared to fPSM. Therefore, it seems legitimate to monitor patients with fPSM. In cases of ePSM, adjuvant treatment appears effective.},

   abstract = {In prostate cancer with biochemical failure after therapy, current imaging techniques have a low detection rate at the prostatespecific antigen (PSA) levels at which targeted salvage therapy is effective. 11C-choline and 18F-fluoromethylcholine, though widely used, have poor sensitivity at low PSA levels. 68Ga-PSMA (Glu-NH-CO-NH-Lys-(Ahx)-[68Ga-N,N'-bis[2-hydroxy-5-(carboxyethyl) benzyl]ethylenediamine-N,N'-diacetic acid]) has shown promising results in retrospective trials. Our aim was to prospectively compare the detection rates of 68Ga-PSMA versus 18F-fluoromethylcholine PET/CT in men who were initially managed with radical prostatectomy, radiation treatment, or both and were being considered for targeted therapy. Methods: A sample of men with a rising PSA level after treatment, eligible for targeted treatment, was prospectively included. Patients on systemic treatment were excluded. 68Ga-PSMA, 18F-fluoromethylcholine PET/CT, and diagnostic CT were performed sequentially on all patients between January and April 2015, and the images were assessed by masked, experienced interpreters. The findings and their impact on management were documented, together with the results of histologic follow-up when feasible. Results: In total, 38 patients were enrolled. Of these, 34 (89%) had undergone radical prostatectomy and 4 (11%) had undergone radiation treatment. Twelve (32%) had undergone salvage radiation treatment after primary radical prostatectomy. The mean PSA level was 1.74 ± 2.54 ng/mL. The scan results were positive in 26 patients (68%) and negative with both tracers in 12 patients (32%). Of the 26 positive scans, 14 (54%) were positive with 68Ga-PSMA alone, 11 (42%) with both 18F-fluoromethylcholine and 68Ga-PSMA, and only 1 (4%) with 18F-fluoromethylcholine alone. When PSA was below 0.5 ng/mL, the detection rate was 50% for 68Ga-PSMA versus 12.5% for 18Ffluoromethylcholine. When PSA was 0.5.2.0 ng/mL, the detection rate was 69% for 68Ga-PSMA versus 31% for 18F-fluoromethylcholine, and when PSA was above 2.0, the detection rate was 86% for 68Ga-PSMA versus 57% for 18F-fluoromethylcholine. On lesion-based analysis, 68Ga-PSMA detected more lesions than 18F-fluoromethylcholine (59 vs. 29, P, 0.001). The tumor-to-background ratio in positive scans was higher for 68Ga-PSMA than for 18F-fluoromethylcholine (28.6 for 68Ga-PSMA vs. 9.4 for 18F-fluoromethylcholine, P, 0.001). There was a 63% (24/38 patients) management impact, with 54% (13/24 patients) being due to 68Ga-PSMA imaging alone. Histologic follow-up was available for 9 of 38 patients (24%), and 9 of 9 68Ga-PSMA.positive lesions were consistent with prostate cancer (68Ga-PSMA was true-positive). The lesion positive on 18F-fluoromethylcholine imaging and negative on 68Ga-PSMA imaging was shown at biopsy to be a false-positive 18F-fluoromethylcholine finding (68Ga-PSMA was true-negative). Conclusion: In patients with biochemical failure and a low PSA level, 68Ga-PSMA demonstrated a significantly higher detection rate than 18F-fluoromethylcholine and a high overall impact on management.},

   abstract = {As breast cancer screening rates increase, smaller and more numerous lesions are being identified earlier, leading to more breast-conserving surgical procedures. Achieving a clean surgical margin represents a technical challenge with important clinical implications. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is introduced as an intraoperative high-resolution imaging technique that assesses surgical breast tumor margins by providing real-time microscopic images up to 2mm beneath the tissue surface. In a study of 37 patients split between training and study groups, OCT images covering 1 cm2 regions were acquired from surgical margins of lumpectomy specimens, registered with ink, and correlated with corresponding histologic sections. A 17-patient training set used to establish standard imaging protocols and OCT evaluation criteria showed that areas of higher scattering tissue with a heterogeneous pattern were indicative of tumor cells and tumor tissue in contrast to lower scattering adipocytes found in normal breast tissue. The remaining 20 patients were enrolled into the feasibility study. Of these lumpectomy specimens, 11 were identified with a positive or close surgical margin and 9 were identified with a negative margin under OCT. Based on histologic findings, 9 true positives, 9 true negatives, 2false positives, and 0 false negatives were found, yielding a sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 82%. These results show the potential of OCT as a real-time method for intraoperative margin assessment in breast-conserving surgeries. ©2009 American Association for Cancer Research.},

   abstract = {Purpose: Breast-conserving surgery (BCS) results in tumour-positive surgical margins in up to 40% of the patients. Therefore, new imaging techniques are needed that support the surgeon with real-time feedback on tumour location and margin status. In this study, the potential of near-infrared fluorescence (NIRF) imaging in BCS for pre- and intraoperative tumour localization, margin status assessment and detection of residual disease was assessed in tissue-simulating breast phantoms. Methods: Breast-shaped phantoms were produced with optical properties that closely match those of normal breast tissue. Fluorescent tumour-like inclusions containing indocyanine green (ICG) were positioned at predefined locations in the phantoms to allow for simulation of (i) preoperative tumour localization, (ii) real-time NIRF-guided tumour resection, and (iii) intraoperative margin assessment. Optical imaging was performed using a custom-made clinical prototype NIRF intraoperative camera. Results: Tumour-like inclusions in breast phantoms could be detected up to a depth of 21 mm using a NIRF intraoperative camera system. Real-time NIRF-guided resection of tumour-like inclusions proved feasible. Moreover, intraoperative NIRF imaging reliably detected residual disease in case of inadequate resection. Conclusion: We evaluated the potential of NIRF imaging applications for BCS. The clinical setting was simulated by exploiting tissue-like breast phantoms with fluorescent tumour-like agarose inclusions. From this evaluation, we conclude that intraoperative NIRF imaging is feasible and may improve BCS by providing the surgeon with imaging information on tumour location, margin status, and presence of residual disease in real-time. Clinical studies are needed to further validate these results. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Intraoperative frozen section analysis (FSA) is one method for margin evaluation. We retrospectively analyzed records of patients who received breast-conserving therapy with intraoperative FSA of the lumpectomy cavity to assess re-excision rates and local control. Methods: Records were retrospectively reviewed for individuals who underwent breast-conserving surgery for ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) or invasive carcinoma between 1993 and 2003. Inclusion criteria were a minimum of 2 years follow-up and intact tumor at the time of operation. The major outcome measure was local recurrence.

Results: 290 subjects with an average age of 57.2 years (range 27-89) underwent 292 lump-ectomies with FSA. 11.3% had DCIS, 73.3% had infiltrating ductal, 5.8% had infiltrating lob-ular, and 9.6% exhibited other forms of invasive carcinoma. 70 subjects underwent additional resection at the time of breast surgery, 16 underwent subsequent re-excision, and 17 underwent subsequent mastectomy. At a median follow-up of 53.4 months (range 5.8-137.8), there were six local recurrences (2.74%) in patients who had breast-conserving procedures and two local recurrences in patients who underwent mastectomy. There were no statistically significant associations among local recurrence rate, tumor size, nodal status, or overall stage. Local recurrences were higher in patients with DCIS compared with invasive carcinoma, and tumors >2cm. Conclusions: Intraoperative FSA allows resection of suspicious or positive margins at the time of lumpectomy and results in low rates of local recurrence and re-excision. The low local recurrence rate reported here is comparable to those reported with other margin assessment techniques.},

   abstract = {Objective: Breast carcinoma is the most frequently diagnosed malignancy in women of North America. The combination of breast conservation surgery and radiotherapy has become a standard of treatment for the majority of breast cancers. It is critical to obtain clear margins to minimize local recurrence. However, avoiding multiple re-excisions for margin clearance helps optimize cosmetic results in patients undergoing breast conservation surgery. Intra-operative touch preparation cytology (IOTPC) may decrease the need for multiple re-excisions and thereby improve cosmesis. The literature suggests that IOTPC can be useful in evaluation of margins. Klimberg et al. evaluated the touch preparation technique prospectively in 428 patients undergoing breast biopsy for undiagnosed breast masses. Margin evaluation was correct in 100% of the lesions and was used to re-excise the margins when touch prep results were positive. They reported a diagnostic accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of 100% for the touch prep technique. To the best of our knowledge, there has been no published data on the role of IOTPC for evaluation of margins in re-excision cases. This report describes our experience with IOTPC for margin assessment for re-excision partial mastectomy at Beth Israel Medical Center (BIMC). The purpose of this study is to determine whether IOTPC is reliable for evaluating margins in patients undergoing re-excision for involved or close margins. Methods: A prospective study of 30 patients, who have undergone re-excision partial mastectomy for involved or close margins after breast conservation surgery with the use of IOTPC for margin assessment at BIMC was performed. The re-excision lumpectomy specimens were oriented by the surgeon intra-operatively and were submitted fresh to pathology for cytologic assessment. The touch prep method consisted of touching the corresponding margin onto the glass slide. The principle of this technique is that if cancer cells are present they will stick to the slide, while fat cells will not. A slide was prepared for each re-excision specimen. Air-dried samples were stained immediately using the Diff-Quik method and examined under the microscope by a cytopathologist. Results: Thirty patients underwent re-excision lumpectomy for involved or close margins with touch preparation cytology for assessment of 68 margins. Twenty-six patients had invasive ductal carcinoma and/or ductal carcinoma in situ, three patients had invasive lobular carcinoma and the remaining one patient had a combination of invasive lobular and ductal carcinoma. There was a correlation between touch prep cytology and final pathology in 56/68 margins, which accounts for 82.4% of the cases.

   abstract = {Purpose: Wide-field surgical excision reduces the chance of residual disease, but can also lead to disfigurement and devastating morbidities when resection is close to critical structures. We hypothesize that near-infrared fluorescence (NIRF) imaging can enable accurate detection of tumor margins for image-guided resection. Experimental Design: An orthotopic model of human prostate cancer (PCa) was used to assess primary tumor margins using a NIRF-labeled antibody against epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM). PCa cells stably expressing far red fluorescent gene reporter, iRFP, enabled colocalization with NIRF signals for direct assessment of tumor margins. Results: Using receiver operating characteristic analysis, far red fluorescence was validated against standard pathology of primary and metastatic lesions with 996 % accuracy. Primary tumor margins were more accurately detected by quantitative NIRF imaging using the EpCAM-targeting antibody as compared to a NIRF-labeled isotype control antibody. Conclusions: NIRF molecular imaging may enable real-time and accurate assessment of tumor margins.},

   abstract = {Background. A multicenter, prospective, blinded study was performed to test the feasibility of using a handheld optical imaging probe for the intraoperative assessment of final surgical margins during breast-conserving surgery (BCS) and to determine the potential impact on patient outcomes. Methods. Forty-six patients with early-stage breast cancer (one with bilateral disease) undergoing BCS at two study sites, the Johns Hopkins Hospital and Anne Arundel Medical Center, were enrolled in this study. During BCS, cavity-shaved margins were obtained and the final margins were examined ex vivo in the operating room with a probe incorporating optical coherence tomography (OCT) hardware and interferometric synthetic aperture microscopy (ISAM) image processing. Images were interpreted after BCS by three physicians blinded to final pathology-reported margin status. Individual and combined interpretations were assessed. Results were compared to conventional postoperative histopathology. Results. A total of 2,191 images were collected and interpreted from 229 shave margin specimens. Of the eight patients (17 %) with positive margins (0 mm), which included invasive and in situ diseases, the device identified all positive margins in five (63 %) of them; reoperation could potentially have been avoided in these patients. Among patients with pathologically negative margins ([0 mm), an estimated mean additional tissue volume of 10.7 ml (approximately 1 % of overall breast volume) would have been unnecessarily removed due to false positives. Conclusions. Intraoperative optical imaging of specimen margins with a handheld probe potentially eliminates the majority of reoperations. Breast-conserving surgery (BCS) is the standard-of-care surgical intervention for early-stage cancer. Margin status in BCS indicates the completeness of tumor resection and is an important factor for ensuring local control. 1 A recent 28,162-patient meta analysis indicated that achieving negative margins is associated with a twofold decrease in ipsilateral tumor recurrence. 2 Reoperation is estimated to occur in 23-38 % of BCS patients due to close/positive histologic margins found in postoperative pathology, although significant variability exists 3 and some locations have reported lower numbers. 3-5 Improved intraoperative assessment may reduce these rates by providing feedback during BCS. Existing intraoperative techniques, such as touch smear/imprinting cytology and frozen-section analysis, have variable accuracy depending on institution, add considerable time (up to 55 min) to the BCS duration, and are not available in some locations. 6-9 Intraoperative ultrasound is more time-efficient but poorly detects ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). 9 Radiofrequency (RF) spectroscopy is a comparatively new technique that analyzes the main BCS specimen using changes in RF impedance spectra and signature matching algorithms to give a ''yes-no'' determination of cancer presence in a},

In addition, several preliminary studies have demonstrated the feasibility and utility of combining intraoperative OCT imaging with novel image-processing and display methods to implement augmented/virtual reality and robotic surgical guidance platforms. While research and commercialization of these innovations have been largely driven by needs in ophthalmology, OCT is finding new clinical applications in surgical oncology and neurosurgery. In this paper, we review recent developments in intraoperative OCT and discuss current trends and future directions of the technology.},

The combined acquisition of PET and CT has synergistic advantages over PET or CT alone and minimizes their individual limitations. It is a valuable tool for staging and restaging of some tumors and has an important role in the detection of recurrence in asymptomatic patients with rising tumor marker levels and patients with negative or equivocal findings on conventional imaging techniques. It also allows for monitoring response to therapy and permitting timely modification of therapeutic regimens. In about 27% of the patients, the course of managment is changed.

This first-in-men study evaluates 68Ga-PSMA for intraoperative assessment of tumor margins at time of robot-assisted radical prostatectomy following preoperative PSMA-PET/CT. Materials & Methods: 3-4 hours prior to surgery, PSMA-PET/CT was performed after intravenous injection of 68Ga-PSMA with varying doses. Scan results were assessed by the specialists of nuclear medicine and urology. Radical prostatectomy was performed robotically and the prostate specimen was imaged with a CLI imager (Lightpoint Medical Ltd, UK)intraoperatively immediately after excision with mean measurement of the radiance on the surface. The agreement of margin distance on histopathology and CLI was assessed. Results: CLI was used in five patients after preoperative injection of 144 mBq 68Ga-PSMA (mean, range 95-202). Intraprostatic lesions were detected by PSMA-PET/CT in 100%, positive lymph nodes could be seen in 3 of 5 patients. CLI was performed intraoperatively after a mean of 329 minutes after tracer injection. Mean background radiance of the prostate was 1441 photons/s/cm2/sr. Positive surgical margins were found in two patients based on histopathology (patient 1: pT3b, pN1, Gleason score 5+3=8, patient 2: pT3a, pN1, Gleason score 4+5=9). In these patients, elevated radiance levels were found in the tumor positive areas (mean radiance: 4254 photons/s/cm2/sr). [Figure presented]Conclusions: Intraoperative 68Ga-PSMA CLI seems to be a promising technique for intraoperative assessment of surgical margins in robot-assisted radical prostatectomy. A prospective trial is mandatory to elucidate further results concerning sensitivity and specificity.},

The ultra-low noise, high resolution, high-quantum efficiency, and robustness to over exposure make these sensors ideally suited to applications traditionally served by image intensifiers. One important performance parameter of such low-light imaging systems is the noise introduced by the gain process. This work investigates the noise introduced by the electron multiplication within the EMCCD. The theory and measurements of the excess noise factor are presented. The measurement technique for determining the excess noise factor is described in detail. The results show that the noise performance matches that of the ideal staircase avalanche photodiode.

The aim of this paper was to study the potential use of CCD and CMOS COTS image sensors as γ-ray detectors. A 60Co γ source was used to study the response behavior of the sensors to the irradiant photons. The results show that the CMOS image sensors have much less background noise before irradiation and have better radiation resistance below 51.24 Gy. The background noise of CCD sensors obviously increases with a larger total ionizing dose. The linearity of the dose-rate response of CCD COTS sensors is better than that of CMOS COTS sensors. Both mean pixel value and cumulative pixel value may be used to obtain the photon dose rate. The sensor technology structure difference leads to the different shapes of events. The Compton scattering of 60Co γ photons in silicon caused the recorded patterns to show not only dots but also small streaks or traces. The peak value provides the photon energy, while the peak shape and radius can be used to classify the particle. CMOS COTS sensors are suitable for the particle classification, while CCD COTS sensors are better for energy resolution.},

   abstract = {A CMOS single photon avalanche diode based time-of-flight sensor is presented for light detection and ranging applications. The sensor integrates 16 structure-optimized single photon avalanche diode pixels and a dual-counter-based 13-bit time-to-digital converter. Each pixel unit has a novel active quench and recharge circuit. The dark noise of single photon avalanche diode is reduced by optimizing the guard ring of the device. The active quench and recharge circuit with a feedback loop is proposed to reduce the dead time. A dual-counter-based time-to-digital converter is designed to prevent counting errors caused by the metastability of the counter in the time-to-digital converter. The sensor is fabricated in 180 nm CMOS standard technology. The measurement results show the median dark count rate of the single photon avalanche diode is 8 kHz at 1 V excess voltage, the highest photon detection efficiency is 18 % at 550 nm light wavelength. The novel active quench circuit effectively reduces the dead time down to 8 ns. The time-to-digital converter with 416 ps resolution makes the system achieve the centimeter-accuracy detection. A 320×160 depth image is captured at a distance of 0.5 m. The maximum depth measurement nonlinear error is 1.9% and the worst-case precision is 3.8%.},

SPADs implemented in planar technology compatible with CMOS circuits offer typical advantages of microelectronic devices (small size, ruggedness, low voltage, low power, etc.). Furthermore, they have inherently higher photon detection efficiency, since they do not rely on electron emission in vacuum from a photocathode as do PMTs, but instead on the internal photoelectric effect. However, PMTs offer much wider sensitive area, which greatly simplifies the design of optical systems; they also attain remarkable performance at high counting rate, and offer picosecond timing resolution with microchannel plate models. In order to make SPAD detectorsmore competitive in a broader range of SPC and TCSPC applications, it is necessary to face several issues in the semiconductor device design and technology. Such issues will be discussed in the context of the two possible approaches to such a challenge: employing a standard industrial high-voltage CMOS technology or developing a dedicated CMOS-compatible technology. Advances recently attained in the development of SPAD detectors will be outlined and discussed with reference to both single-element detectors and integrated detector arrays. ©2007 IEEE.},

   abstract = {Abstract Some decades ago single photon detection used to be the terrain of photomultiplier tube (PMT), thanks to its characteristics of sensitivity and speed. However, PMT has several disadvantages such as low quantum efficiency, overall dimensions, and cost, making them unsuitable for compact design of integrated systems. So, the past decade has seen a dramatic increase in interest in new integrated single-photon detectors called Single-Photon Avalanche Diodes (SPAD) or Geiger-mode APD. SPAD are working in avalanche mode above the breakdown level. When an incident photon is captured, a very fast avalanche is triggered, generating an easily detectable current pulse. This paper discusses SPAD detectors fabricated in a standard CMOS technology featuring both single-photon sensitivity, and excellent timing resolution, while guaranteeing a high integration. In this work, we investigate the design of SPAD detectors using the AMS 0.35 $μ$m CMOS Opto technology. Indeed, such standard CMOS technology allows producing large surface (few mm2) of single photon sensitive detectors. Moreover, SPAD in CMOS technologies could be associated to electronic readout such as active quenching, digital to analog converter, memories and any specific processing required to build efficient calorimeters1 (Silicon PhotoMultiplier - SiPM) or high resolution imagers (SPAD imager). The present work investigates SPAD geometry. MOS transistor has been used instead of resistor to adjust the quenching resistance and find optimum value. From this first set of results, a detailed study of the dark count rate (DCR) has been conducted. Our results show a dark count rate increase with the size of the photodiodes and the temperature (at T=22.5°C, the DCR of a 10 $μ$m-photodiode is 2020 count s-1 while it is 270 count s-1 at T=-40°C for a overvoltage of 800 mV). A small pixel size is desirable, because the DCR per unit area decreases with the pixel size. We also found that the adjustment of overvoltage is very sensitive and depends on the temperature. The temperature will be adjusted for the subsequent experiments.},

A comprehensive nonuniformity analysis was conducted on a 512 × 128 pixel gated SPAD imager, where dark noise, afterpulsing, crosstalk, signal response, and shot noise were measured. This analysis has led to a variety of postprocessing algorithms to improve the linearity of the response as for example required by ground state depletion microscopy-based superresolution microscopy and other techniques.

A fully digital implementation of the Silicon Photomultiplier (dSiPM) has been developed in order to overcome the deficiencies and limitations of the so far only analog SiPMs (aSiPMs). Our sensor is based on arrays of single photon avalanche photodiodes (SPADs) integrated in a standard CMOS process. Photons are detected directly by sensing the voltage at the SPAD anode using a dedicated cell electronics block next to each diode. This block also contains active quenching and recharge circuits as well as a one bit memory for the selective inhibit of detector cells. A balanced trigger network is used to propagate the trigger signal from all cells to the integrated time-to-digital converter. In consequence, photons are detected and counted as digital signals, thus making the sensor less susceptible to temperature variations and electronic noise. The integration with CMOS logic provides the added benefit of low power consumption and possible integration of data post-processing directly in the sensor. In this overview paper, we discuss the sensor architecture together with its characteristics with a focus on scalability and practicability aspects for applications in medical imaging, high energy- and astrophysics.},

   abstract = {Raman spectroscopy is a powerful analytical tool to be used in many biomedical applications and could be potentially translated into clinical work. The challenge of Raman spectroscopy in biomedical applications is the high inherent fluorescence of biological samples. One promising method to suppress the fluorescence background is to use pulsed lasers and time-gated detectors but the complexity of time-gated systems has hindered their widespread usage. We present here chemical imaging of human teeth by means of a new kind of compact and practical fluorescence-suppressed Raman spectrometer based on a time-resolved 16 × 256 CMOS single-photon avalanche diode (SPAD) line sensor with an integrated 256-channel 3-bit on-chip time-to-digital converter. The chemical images were constructed by utilizing a simple unsupervised machine learning algorithm (k-means clustering). The high quality of Raman spectra measured with the time-resolved CMOS SPAD-based Raman spectrometer was verified by comparing the spectra to those collected with a commercial conventional continuous wave (CW) Raman spectrometer. The spectra measured by using the time-resolved CMOS SPAD-based Raman spectrometer had 4.4-8.8 times higher signal to peak-to-peak noise ratio values than the spectra from the CW Raman spectrometer when the same radiant exposure (∼300 J mm-2) was used with both spectrometers. This paper shows in practice the potential of time-resolved CMOS SPAD-based Raman spectroscopy in the field of biomedicine and we expect that the presented technology could pave the way for the development of new kind of compact and practical fluorescence-suppressed Raman spectrometers to be used both in biomedical research and clinical settings.},

The system combines an ul-trafast frame rate with single-photon sensitivity and was employed on a fluorescence microscope to image decays of ruthenium compound Ru(dpp) with lifetimes from around 1 to 5 $μ$s. A submicrowatt excitation power over the whole field of view is sufficient for this approach, and compatibility with live-cell imaging was demonstrated by imaging europium-containing beads with a lifetime of 570 $μ$s in living HeLa cells. A standard two-photon excitation scanning fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIM) system was used to independently verify the lifetime for the europium beads. This approach brings together advantageous features for time-resolved live-cell imaging such as low excitation intensity, single-photon sensitivity, ultrafast camera frame rates, and short acquisition times. ©2014 Optical Society of America OCIS codes: (040.3780) Low light level; (110.0180) Microscopy; (170.2520) Fluorescence microscopy; (170.6920) Time-resolved imaging; (170.3650) Lifetime-based sensing; (030.5260) Photon counting.},

   abstract = {Ultraviolet photodetectors have applications in fields such as medicine, communications and defence 1 , and are typically made from single-crystalline silicon, silicon carbide or gallium nitride p-n junction photodiodes. However, such inorganic photodetectors are unsuitable for certain applications because of their high cost and low responsivity (<0.2 A W 21) 2. Solution-processed photodetectors based on organic materials and/or nanomaterials could be significantly cheaper to manufacture , but their performance so far has been limited 2-7. Here, we show that a solution-processed ultraviolet photo-detector with a nanocomposite active layer composed of ZnO nanoparticles blended with semiconducting polymers can significantly outperform inorganic photodetectors. As a result of interfacial trap-controlled charge injection, the photodetec-tor transitions from a photodiode with a rectifying Schottky contact in the dark, to a photoconductor with an ohmic contact under illumination, and therefore combines the low dark current of a photodiode and the high responsivity of a photoconductor (∼721-1,001 A W 21). Under a bias of <10 V, our device provides a detectivity of 3.4 3 10 15 Jones at 360 nm at room temperature, which is two to three orders of magnitude higher than that of existing inorganic semiconductor ultraviolet photodetectors. The use of solution-processed thin films of colloidal inorganic semiconductor nanoparticles or colloidal quantum dots as photo-conductors has been a critical step in the quest to fabricate low-cost photodetectors. Several types of nanomaterials, including PbS colloidal quantum dots and ZnO nanoparticles, have been used to measure different response spectra ranging from the near-infrared to the ultraviolet 2-4,6,8. These photodetectors demonstrate remarkably high responsivities-greater than 1,000 A W 21 in the near-infrared range 3,6 and 61 A W 21 in the ultraviolet 2. However, the lateral structure adopted in these photoconductive photodetectors inevitably leads to large driving voltages and slow responses. A large lateral electrode spacing (.5 mm) is required to increase the shunt resistance and reduce the dark current, so, to maintain high gain, these photodetectors need a very high driving voltage of 100 V, which cannot be provided by commercially available thin-film transistors 2,3,7. The response speed of lateral-structure photoconductive photodetectors is also sacrificed to maintain this high gain. Gain is determined by the ratio of the lifetime of the free charge and the transit time 9. A large electrode spacing is needed to allow more light to be absorbed, both for high gain and to reduce the dark current, but this increases the transit time of the charges across the electrodes. A long trapping time (on the scale of minutes) is therefore needed, which inevitably limits the applications of these photodetectors 2,3,6. A vertical-structure photoconductive photodetector, with its much smaller electrode spacing, has a much shorter carrier transit length, therefore providing high gain as well as a quick response. A photoactive layer thickness of 500 nm is generally thick enough to absorb most of the ultraviolet radiation, as a result of the high absorption coefficient of many types of nanoparticles in the ultraviolet range 10. One challenge in making a vertical-structure photoconductive photodetector with such a thin absorber film is dealing with the large dark current injected from its much larger electrode contact area than in lateral structures. Ohmic contact with at least one of the electrodes is required to take advantage of the high gain of the photoconductors 9. However, the large charge injection, combined with the relatively smaller shunt resistance (due to the much shorter charge transit length than in the lateral structure), will result in a large dark current, which can ruin the detectivity of the photodetector 11. The large dark current problem is exacerbated when using non-dense nanoparticle films, which are susceptible to the penetration of metal atoms by diffusion during metallization and subsequent thermal treatment. We have developed a highly sensitive ultraviolet photodetector with a vertical device structure combining the gain of a photocon-ductor and the low noise of a diode. The active-layer materials are nanocomposites composed of ZnO nanoparticles blended with semiconducting polymers. ZnO is emerging as a potential alternative to GaN or SiC as an ultraviolet absorber due to its wide bandgap of 3.4 eV, low-cost material and variable synthetic strategies 2,12-19. Our nanocomposite photodetectors were fabricated using a low-cost spin-coating process, which is compatible with complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) readout circuits 4. The structure and operating principle of our photodetector are presented in Fig. 1. The simple device structure comprises a polymer:ZnO nanocomposite layer sandwiched between a transparent indium tin oxide (ITO) anode and an aluminium cathode (for chemical structures of the materials see Supplementary Fig. S1). This device structure is essentially the same as those of polymer:na-noparticle hybrid solar cells 20-22 or bistable memories 23 , except that the nanoparticles work as charge traps in our photodetector instead of as charge conductors (as is the case in hybrid solar cells). Two types of hole-conducting semiconducting polymers were used to obtain different response spectra (Fig. 1b): poly-3(hexylthiophene) (P3HT, optical bandgap of 1.9 eV) for UV-vis detection and poly-vinylcarbazole (PVK, bandgap of 3.5 eV) for ultraviolet detection. PVK is used because of its reasonably high hole mobility and very high bandgap, although it is not a conjugated polymer. To minimize the dark current, a thin layer of 4,4 ′-bis[(p-trichlorosilylpropylphe-nyl)phenylamino]-biphenyl (TPD-Si 2) and PVK blend was inserted between poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) poly(styrenesulphonate) (PEDOT:PSS) and the nanocomposite layer as an electron-blocking/hole-conducting layer. This material blend combines the hole-injection and hole-transport capabilities of TPD-Si 2 24 with the electron-blocking capability of PVK and has been shown to reduce the dark current by two to three orders of magnitude in our devices. The hole-transport layer was crosslinked by annealing TPD-Si 2 in air so that the photoactive layer coating step that},

   abstract = {Many demanding applications require single-photon detectors with very large active area, very low noise, high detection efficiency, and precise time response. Single-photon avalanche diodes (SPADs) provide all the advantages of solid-state devices, but in many applications other single-photon detectors, like photomultiplier tubes, have been preferred so far due to their larger active area. We developed silicon SPADs with active area diameters as large as 500 m in a fully standard CMOS process. The 500 m SPAD exhibits 55% peak photon detection efficiency at 420 nm, 8 kcps of dark counting rate at 0°C, and high uniformity of the sensitivity in the active area. These devices can be used with on-chip integrated quenching circuitry, which reduces the afterpulsing probability, or with external circuits to achieve even better photon-timing performances, as good as 92 ps FWHM for a 100 m diameter SPAD. Owing to the state-of-the-art performance, not only compared to CMOS SPADs but also SPADs developed in custom technologies, very high uniformity and low crosstalk probability, these CMOS SPADs can be successfully employed in detector arrays and single-chip imagers for single-photon counting and timing applications. ©2014 Taylor & Francis.},

Each pixel is 570 ,×,610 $\mu\{\$\}m 2 in size and contains four digital mini-SiPMs, for a total of 720 SPADs, resulting in a full chip fill-factor of 35.7%. For each gamma detection, the pixel provides the total detected energy and a timestamp, obtained through two 7-b counters and two 12-b 64-ps TDCs. An adder tree overlaid on top of the pixel array sums the sensor total counts at up to 100 Msamples/s, which are then used for detecting the asynchronous gamma events on-chip, while also being output in real-time. Characterization of gamma detection performance with an 3, ×,3, ×,5 mm 3 LYSO scintillator at 20 circC is reported, showing a 511-keV gamma energy resolution of 10.9% and a coincidence timing resolution of 399 ps. ©2013 IEEE.},

In this work we present an on-chip narrowband thermal light source for the mid-infrared wavelength range by combining microelectromechanical system (MEMS) heaters with metamaterial perfect emitter structures. Exhibiting a resonance quality factor of 15.7 at the center wavelength of 3.96 $μ$m and an emissivity of 0.99, the demonstrated emitter is a spectrally narrow and efficient light source. We show temperature-stable (resonance wavelength shift 0.04 nm/°C) and angular-independent emission characteristics up to angles of 50° and provide an equivalent circuit model illustrating the structure's resonance behavior. Owing to its spectrally tailored, nondispersive emission, additional filter elements in a free-space optical gas sensing setup become obsolete. In a proof-of-concept demonstration of such a filter-free gas sensing system with CO2 concentrations in the range of 0-50000 ppm, we observe a 5-fold increase in relative sensitivity compared to the use of a conventional blackbody emitter. Our light source is fully compatible with standard CMOS processes and tunable in emission wavelength through the mid-infrared wavelength band. It paves the way for a new class of highly integrated, low-cost optical gas sensors.},

The circuit is fabricated in 0.35$μ$ m high-voltage CMOS technology and it allows a measurement rate of 400 kframe/s. In order to be able to separate the Raman and fluorescence photons even in the presence of the unavoidable timing skew of the timing signals of the TDC, the time-of-arrival of every detected photon is recorded with high time resolution at each spectral point with respect to the emitted short and intensive laser pulse (150 ps). The dynamic range of the TDC is set so that no Raman photon is lost due to the timing skew, and thus the complete time history of the detected photons is available at each spectral point. The resolution of the TDC was designed to be adjustable from 50 ps to 100 ps. The error caused by the timing skew and the residual variation in the resolution of the TDC along the spectral points is mitigated utilizing a calibration measurement from reference sample with known smooth fluorescence spectrum. As a proof of concept, the Raman spectrum of sesame seed oil, having a high fluorescence-to-Raman ratio and a short fluorescence lifetime of 1.9 ns, was successfully recorded.},

One of its main problems, however, is background radiation that is caused by ambient light and sample fluorescence. We present here, to the best of our knowledge, the first time a distance-resolving Raman radar device that is based on an adjustable, time-correlated complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) single-photon avalanche diode line sensor which can measure the location of the target sample simultaneously with the normal stand-off spectrometer operation and suppress the background radiation dramatically by means of sub-nanosecond time gating. A distance resolution of 3.75 cm could be verified simultaneously during normal spectrometer operation and Raman spectra of titanium dioxide were distinguished by this system at distances of 250 cm and 100 cm with illumination intensities of the background of 250 lux and 7600 lux, respectively. In addition, the major Raman peaks of olive oil, which has a fluorescence-to-Raman signal ratio of 33 and a fluorescence lifetime of 2.5 ns, were distinguished at a distance of 30 cm with a 250 lux background illumination intensity. We believe that this kind of time-correlated CMOS single-photon avalanche diode sensor could pave the way for new compact distance-resolving Raman radars for application where distance information within a range of several metres is needed at the same time as a Raman spectrum.},

   abstract = {The working horse for the detection of photons is the photomultiplier tube (PMT) which has been a commercial product since 1936. It is an elaborated device but still, after 70 years, impressive improvements have recently been achieved. PMTs however have two severe draw backs: they are sensitive to magnetic fields and they are expensive because the complicated mechanical structure inside the vacuum container is mostly handmade. This initiated the search for alternative devices. Photon sensitive semiconductor devices (PIN-photodiodes, avalanche photodiodes and recently Geiger-mode avalanche photodiodes) have been developed and have already replaced PMTs in many fields of research and will gain more ground in the near future. Geiger-mode avalanche photodiodes have an especially high potential because they have high gain and need no or only a simple amplifier and they can be produced with a standard and cost effective CMOS technique. However, when very large areas have to be covered the cheapest device is still probably a gaseous photomultiplier. Detectors based on the so-called Gas Electron Multiplier (GEM) foils, which minimize the harmful ion feedback, have high gain and even so a very long lifetime. ©2006 Elsevier B.V.

In photon-counting mode, the imager provides photonnumber (i.e., intensity) resolvedmovies of the scene under observation, up to 100 000 frames/s. In photon-timing, the imager provides photon arrival times with 312 ps resolution. The result are videos with either time-resolved (e.g., fluorescence) maps of a sample, or 3-D depth-resolvedmaps of a target scene. The imager is fabricated in a cost-effective 0.35-$μ$m CMOS technology, automotive certified. Each pixel consists of a single-photon avalanche diode with 30 $μ$m photoactive diameter, coupled to an in-pixel 10-bit time-to-digital converter with 320-ns full-scale range, an INL of 10% LSB and a DNL of 2% LSB. The chip operates in global shutter mode, with full frame times down to 10 $μ$s and just 1-ns conversion time. The reconfigurable imager design enables a broad set of applications, like time-resolved spectroscopy, fluorescence lifetime imaging, diffusive optical tomography, molecular imaging, time-of-flight 3-D ranging and atmospheric layer sensing through LIDAR.},

   abstract = {The development of silicon semiconductor technology has produced breakthroughs in electronics-from the microprocessor in the late 1960s to early 1970s, to automation, computers and smartphones-by downscaling the physical size of devices and wires to the nanometre regime. Now, graphene and related two-dimensional (2D) materials offer prospects of unprecedented advances in device performance at the atomic limit, and a synergistic combination of 2D materials with silicon chips promises a heterogeneous platform to deliver massively enhanced potential based on silicon technology. Integration is achieved via three-dimensional monolithic construction of multifunctional high-rise 2D silicon chips, enabling enhanced performance by exploiting the vertical direction and the functional diversification of the silicon platform for applications in opto-electronics and sensing. Here we review the opportunities, progress and challenges of integrating atomically thin materials with silicon-based nanosystems, and also consider the prospects for computational and non-computational applications. A dvances in semiconductor technology have manifested in the doubling of the number of components (for example, transistors) per die at a regular interval (for example, every two years), which is loosely called Moore's law. In 2018, the semiconductor industry crossed the 10-nm threshold to offer silicon logic technologies at the 7-nm technology node, with the 5-nm and 3-nm nodes expected in the foreseeable future. (A technology node is a generation of semiconductor manufacturing processes associated with a particular size.) Meanwhile, memory technologies have already changed course and departed from the traditional scaling of geometry. Dynamic random access memory (DRAM) has virtually stopped dimensional downscaling, and has tran-sitioned into the stacking of DRAM chips with logic chips to provide the memory capacity, reduced latency and increased bandwidth required of today's computing systems. Flash memory (in particular, NAND flash), which has become the dominant non-volatile data storage device, has also stopped dimensional downscaling in the 2D plane of the chip. Current and future generations of flash memory are providing increasingly larger storage capacity by building up multiple layers of memory cells in the third dimension, in a way akin to a high-rise building. Flash memories with 64 layers were already in production in 2018, with further opportunities for taller, high-rise memory chips. Silicon wonderland Will future logic technologies continue to provide the energy efficiency required of computing systems? Will emerging applications (for example , in optoelectronics and sensors) and future computation workloads (such as neuromorphic and quantum computing) demand new materials and device concepts compatible with Si CMOS integration? How will technology progression be assessed now that the linear dimensions of devices have ceased to serve as a meaningful metric? In the same sense, how will the added value of integrating 2D materials (2DMs) and new materials be evaluated? These are some of the most pressing questions facing the semiconductor industry today. They are in particular put in a special context by considering the many advantages and diverse functions that are afforded by 2DMs, which can have a massive economic impact in leveraging ubiquitous Si technology (see Fig. 1a).},

   abstract = {With the emergence of large arrays of high-functionality pixels, it has become critical to characterize the performance non-uniformity of such arrays. In this paper we characterize a 160x128 array of complex pixels, each with a single-photon avalanche diode (SPAD) and a time-to-digital converter (TDC). A study of the array's non-uniformities in terms of the timing resolution, jitter, and photon responsivity is conducted for the pixels at various illumination levels, temperatures, and other operating conditions. In the study we found that, in photon-starved operation, the TDCs exhibit a median resolution of 55ps and a standard deviation of 2 ps. The pixels show a median timing jitter of 140ps. Moreover, we measured negligible variations in photon responsivity while changing the number of active pixels. These findings suggest that the image sensor can be used in highly reliable, large-scale, time-correlated measurements of single photons for biological, molecular, and medical applications. The chip is especially valuable for time-resolved imaging, single-photon counting, and correlation-spectroscopy under many realistic operating conditions. ©2011 IEEE.},

Different complementary metal–oxide–semiconductor (CMOS) devices have been reported in the literature, with quite different performance and some excelling in just few of them, but often at different operating conditions. In order to provide proper criteria for performance assessment, we present some figures of merit (FoMs) able to summarize the typical SPAD performance (i.e. photon detection efficiency, dark counting rate, afterpulsing probability, hold-off time, and timing jitter) and to identify a proper metric for SPAD comparisons, when used either as single-pixel detectors or in imaging arrays. The ultimate goal is not to define a ranking list of best-in-class detectors, but to quantitatively help the end-user to state the overall performance of different SPADs in either photoncounting, timing, or imaging applications. We review many CMOS SPADs from different research groups and companies, we compute the proposed FoMs for all them and, eventually, we provide an insight on present CMOS SPAD technologies and future trends.},

Then, the dominant noise source in CMOS image sensors, photon shot noise, is introduced, and its implications for the imaging system are discussed. Various approaches to digitizing the output of image sensors are described, including the single-slope, multi-ramp column-parallel architecture that is matched to the sensor's noise characteristics. Finally, the chapter introduces state-of-the-art approaches to improving light sensitivity, including micro-lenses and back-side illumination, approaches to improving dynamic range, including multiple exposure and local overflow techniques, and approaches to reducing rolling-shutter artefacts},

   abstract = {Changes in measured image irradiance have many physical causes and are the primary cue for several visual processes, such as edge detection and shape from shading. Using physical models for charged-coupled device (CCD) video cameras and material reflectance, we quantify the variation in digitized pixel values that is due to sensor noise and scene variation. This analysis forms the basis of algorithms for camera characterization and calibration and for scene description. Specifically, algorithms are developed for estimating the parameters of camera noise and for calibrating a camera to remove the effects of fixed pattern nonuniformity and spatial variation in dark current. While these techniques have many potential uses, we describe in particular how they can be used to estimate a measure of scene variation. This measure is independent of image irradiance and can be used to identify a surface from a single sensor band over a range of situations. Experimental results confirm that the models presented in this paper are useful for modeling the different sources of variation in real images obtained from video cameras. © 1994 IEEE},

A simple and accurate model for the junction capacitance of the photodiode is proposed. An analytic expression for the output voltage of the APS obtained with this capacitance model is in good agreement with measurements and is more accurate than the models used previously. A different mode of operation for the APS based on the dc level of the output is suggested. This new mode has better low-light-level sensitivity than the conventional APS operating mode, and it has a slower temporal response to the change of the incident light power. At 1μW/cm2 and lower levels of light, the measured signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of this new mode is more than 10 dB higher than the SNR of previously reported APS circuits. Also, with an output SNR of about 10 dB, the proposed dc level is capable of detecting light powers as low as 20 nW/cm2, which is about 30 times lower than the light power detected in recent reports by other groups. © 2007 IEEE.},

The A and C types are found in significant proportions outside East Asia, that is, in Europeans and Americans. In contrast, the B type is the most common type in East Asia, and its ancestral genome appears not to have spread outside East Asia without first mutating into derived B types, pointing to founder effects or immunological or environmental resistance against this type outside Asia.

   abstract = {Reactively evaporated TiO2 thin films were deposited on the glass substrate by electron beam heating technique. In the first stage evaporation rates are varied keeping substrate temperature fixed at 200 C and oxygen flow rate at 9.0 sccm for all the samples. The deposition rates were varied from 0.120.20 nm/s with a step of 0.02 to optimize the optical constants for the film in the wavelength band of 380850 nm as a high index material for multilayer optical coatings and filters. The films prepared at higher deposition rates have shown low refractive index values and comparatively higher extinction coefficients for the given substrate temperature in the desired spectral range. The best optical constants were observed for the sample prepared at 0.12 nm/s (at λ = 550 nm: n: 2.39 and k: of the order of 109). However, the variation in refractive index for all the samples was found to be in the range of 2.392.21 at 550 nm. In the second stage, films were prepared at a fixed deposition rate of 0.12 nm/s at different substrate temperature (50 C, 100 C, 150 C and 200 C) to study the optical properties of the films as a function of substrate temperature in order to investigate the potential of TiO2 film application as medium index layer. It was observed that refractive index decreases with decreasing substrate temperature. However, it was not found true for absorption. Instead, at Ts = 50 C extremely low absorption (of the order of 105) has been observed with refractive index of 1.83, which increased sharply for next higher substrate temperature. Variation in absorption characteristics is found with varying substrate temperatures. The result shows that TiO2 films can be used as high and medium index layer in optical coating by varying the deposition parameters during growth. Effectively, one can achieve performance of two materials with only one. This effect could be utilized to produce variable index layers and coatings. Two samples with best high and medium optical constant values, were further investigated using Atomic force microscopy (AFM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) for surface and structure analysis. The results show that the particle size for the film is very small (1020 nm), and the surface appears to be very compact, smooth and free of pinholes with roughness in angstrom range, extremely suitable for optical applications in single and multilayer structures.},

   abstract = {Gamma cameras based on charge-coupled devices (CCDs) coupled to continuous scintillation crystals can combine a good detection efficiency with high spatial resolutions with the aid of advanced scintillation detection algorithms. A previously developed analytical multi-scale algorithm (MSA) models the depth-dependent light distribution but does not take statistics into account. Here we present and validate a novel statistical maximum-likelihood algorithm (MLA) that combines a realistic light distribution model with an experimentally validated statistical model. The MLA was tested for an electron multiplying CCD optically coupled to CsI(Tl) scintillators of different thicknesses. For 99mTc imaging, the spatial resolution (for perpendicular and oblique incidence), energy resolution and signal-to-background counts ratio (SBR) obtained with the MLA were compared with those of the MSA. Compared to the MSA, the MLA improves the energy resolution by more than a factor of 1.6 and the SBR is enhanced by more than a factor of 1.3. For oblique incidence (approximately 45°), the depth-of-interaction corrected spatial resolution is improved by a factor of at least 1.1, while for perpendicular incidence the MLA resolution does not consistently differ significantly from the MSA result for all tested scintillator thicknesses. For the thickest scintillator (3 mm, interaction probability 66% at 141 keV) a spatial resolution (perpendicular incidence) of 147 νm full width at half maximum (FWHM) was obtained with an energy resolution of 35.2% FWHM. These results of the MLA were achieved without prior calibration of scintillations as is needed for many statistical scintillation detection algorithms. We conclude that the MLA significantly improves the gamma camera performance compared to the MSA. © 2011 Institute of Physics and Engineering in Medicine.},

Additionally, for the Ti layers, the sheet resistance was determined. The produced coatings exhibit privileged direction of growth (002). The obtained results show a gradual increase in the mean relaxation time of free-carriers with the increase in the thickness of titanium film. However, the plasma energy exhibits maximum for the coating with the thickness of 93 nm. For such thickness, the lowest value of optical resistivity (about 200 µΩ cm) was observed. It was found that the dc-and optical resistivity exhibit similar values for titanium films with thickness up to 93 nm. For thicker Ti layers, significant differences in resistivities (dc-and optical) were noticed. The behavior of the Drude parameter (the plasma energy), calculated optical resistivity, and discrepancies between values of optical and dc-resistivities for thicker Ti coatings can be explained as a result of the limited light penetration.},

   abstract = {This article presents how nanotechnology impacts optics, namely how miniaturization of matter impacts the interaction and propagation of light in matter, especially and most interestingly in metal and semiconductors. In a nanometal medium, light can be guided, confined, and focused far beyond what conventional dielectric technology offers. Whereas in a dielectric medium, focusing is wavelength-limited (diffraction-limited) to ~300 nm at best, in a nanometal medium it is independent of the incoming wavelength, with no limit as it is only limited by the size of the nanostructure, practically confining light into super intense “hot-spots.” Moreover, nanometal shows strong color change and becomes hot and highly interactive with the environment upon light illumination. On the other hand, upon miniaturization, semiconductors provide strong size-dependent luminescence covering the full range of the RGB colors of light; becoming much brighter and may turn material from dull to glowing nature; and upon functionalization can be made highly selective in its interaction with the environment. Finally synergetic functionalities have been observed upon integration of the functionalities of nanometal and semiconductor. As to application, these novel and unprecedented functionalities have the potential to enable exciting applications in service of fields as diverse as electronics, opto- and photo-electronics, elementary particles, biomedicine, nanolithography and fabrication, and energy harvest and lighting. Finally the article presents a brief discussion of the use of nanometal lighting effects in ancient stained glass and lusterware pottery as well as a historical perspective on the development of light-matter interaction since the pioneering work of Alhazen, a millennium ago.},

Thus, the membrane acts as separator and also reaction vessel where the reaction occurs. Integration of continuous ethanol fermentation and membrane separation by pervaporation using an ethanol permselective polydimethylsiloxane membrane was performed. A laboratory-scale membrane bioreactor (MBR) was designed and fabricated that is applicable for design of a large-scale MBR. The performance of \{MBR\} with dilution rates of 0.04–0.24 h−1 was compared to conventional fermentation under similar geometrical and physicochemical conditions. For ethanol fermentation, in fresh medium glucose concentration of 100 g l−1 and Saccharomyces cerevisiae as biocatalysts were used. Optimum dilution rate of 0.14 h−1 was obtained based on maximum ethanol productivity. Maximum specific cell growth rate was found 0.27 h−1. The pervaporated ethanol concentrations were approximately six to seven times higher than ethanol concentration in conventional fermentation. Integration of continuous ethanol fermentation and membrane separation by pervaporation using an ethanol permselective polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) membrane was performed. A laboratory-scale membrane bioreactor (MBR) was designed and fabricated that is applicable for design of a large-scale MBR. The performance of \{MBR\} with dilution rates of 0.04–0.24 h−1 was compared to conventional fermentation under similar geometrical and physicochemical conditions. For ethanol fermentation, fresh medium glucose concentration of 100 g l−1 and Saccharomyces cerevisiae as biocatalysts were used. Optimum dilution rate of 0.14 h−1 was obtained based on maximum ethanol productivity. Maximum specific cell growth rate was found to be 0.27 h−1. The ethanol productivity has increased at least by 22% over conventional continuous fermentation. Furthermore, pervaporated ethanol concentrations were approximately six to seven times higher than ethanol concentration in conventional fermentation. However, at very high dilution rate, the performance of membrane permeation system was quite similar to conventional fermentation; this was due to insufficient incubation time. At optimum dilution rate, experiments were performed at very high substrate concentration of 135–230 g l−1. Maximum ethanol yield was devoted to substrate concentration of 170 g l−1. Compared to conventional continuous fermentation, \{MBR\} had great advantages in terms of elimination of substrate and product inhibitions; \{MBR\} can handle high substrate concentration, with high cell density and high ethanol productivity. Sol–gel is one of the most useful techniques for preparation of inorganic membranes with fine pores in the nanometer range (1–5 nm). The sol is a stable suspension of colloidal solid particles within soft uniform solution. The gel was obtained by hydrolysis with open reflux in 24 h at 85–90 °C. The advantage of sol–gel technology is the ability to produce highly pure γ-alumina and zirconia membranes at medium temperatures of about 700 °C with uniform pore size distribution in a thin film. However, the major disadvantage of this process is that the membrane is sensitive to heat treatment, resulting in cracking on the film layer. Successful crack-free products were produced, but they needed special care and time for suitable heat curing. Only γ-alumina membranes have the disadvantage of poor chemical and thermal stability. There was no opportunity to carry heat treatment at very high temperatures above 700 °C, where at 900 °C it was expected the transformation of γ-aluminum from γ → θ → α-alumina may take place. Successful coating on supported membrane products was obtained using ZrO2. Suitable supported and unsupported zirconia-alumina membranes were developed and fabricated using the sol–gel technique. More than one hundred samples of successful and unsuccessful membranes for demonstration were fabricated. The successful results are presented and discussed. In this project, the porous ceramic supports and the metal-oxide-coated membranes were fabricated in the research laboratory at the Universiti Sains Malaysia. },

Alternatively, atomic force microscopy (AFM) and interference (INT) across the step of a partially removed aluminum layer yield geometrical values, and optical density (OD) and electrical resistance (ER) measure other properties. We compared the ability of these methods to determine the thickness of aluminum coatings applied to polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and paper by physical vapor deposition. We measured ER using four-point probes, five-point probes, and eddy currents. ER and OD achieved high precision but low accuracy, showing that the resistivity and absorption coefficients of thin aluminum layers can deviate from bulk constants. When the constant values were adjusted, both methods achieved higher accuracy. ICP-MS and QCM values were similar, when a geometrical model was applied, and in comparison AFM and INT showed low precision but high accuracy. When the aluminum was applied to paper instead of PET, only ICP-MS generated reliable results. In summary, the values derived using these different methods are only in agreement when method-specific constants such as absorption coefficients and resistivity are suitably modified.},

   abstract = {The angular distributions of Cu particles sputtered from a cylindrical ͑post͒ magnetron were measured in a pinhole arrangement at various working gas pressures. The differentially pumped pinhole camera—described in a previous article—allows measurements in a pressure range up to 10 Pa and samples the three-dimensional distributions in planar sections. Two different planes, namely, parallel and perpendicular to the magnetron axis, were selected for the investigation. Cu was sputtered by Ar ions with an energy of about 0.5 keV from a post magnetron with a very uniform erosion zone. The orifice of the pinhole camera was located at a distance of 50 mm from the cathode surface and in the middle of the erosion zone. The working gas pressure was varied from 0.1 to 1 Pa. The angular distribution of particles was deduced from thickness measurements of films deposited on a semicircular substrate with a 21 mm radius centered around the pinhole. The pressure-dependent amount of scattering was studied by comparing the measured angular distributions with either analytic results neglecting scattering and with those calculated by Monte Carlo simulations of the gas phase transport. Experiment and simulation give good agreement, especially in the low-pressure range. For high working gas pressures good quantitative coincidence of calculation and experiment can only be achieved by introducing a pressure-dependent exponent n in the cos n ␪ particle emission characteristic from the target. Generally it can be concluded that, for all considered gas pressures, sputtered neutrals show angular distributions far from isotropy.},

We discuss the conditions where this is possible and how to determine the optical constants for the material. The determination of the thickness of each of two metals in a bimetallic stack is discussed. Finally, by measuring thickness with these methods and measuring weight gain, we determine the density of platinum deposited by evaporation and deposited by a simple sputter deposition method. Explicitly, one of the results is that the determined optical constants depend on the deposition method. This implies that, with only a few exceptions, one must determine the optical constants of the material of interest, and that it is inappropriate to use values from another source such as a handbook or from another investigator. The resulting optical constants in this work suggest that the microstructure of the platinum films from the two different methods will not be the same, and x-ray diffraction and sheet resistance measurements verify that this is the case. Specifically, the significantly lower extinction coefficient of the sputter-deposited films correlates with a higher sheet resistance. Copyright © 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

   abstract = {As interest in plasmonics grows the optical properties of thin metal films becomes increasingly significant. Here we explore the transmissivity of thin metal films at normal incidence, from the ultraviolet to microwaves, and show how, contrary to simplistic treatments, the microwave transmissivity may be much less than the optical transmissivity for films which are well below the skin depth in thickness. This arises because the film is acting as a zero order Fabry-Perot with very high reflectivity at each interface. The skin depth then becomes irrelevant for thin metal films at microwave frequencies. We also note in passing that the expected exponential dependence on thickness at higher thicknesses has an asymptotic limit at zero thickness which may be as high as four times the input intensity.A surface plasmon polariton study of the dielectric-constants of reactive metals-Aluminium," Thin Solid Films 167, 73-83 (1988). The optical properties of thin metal films has long been a subject of scientific research. Over the past decade there has been a resurgence of interest in this area primarily as a result of Ebbesen and coworkers observation of strongly enhanced transmission through holey metal films [1]. Further interest in thin metal films has also been stimulated by Pendry's suggestion of using thin metal layers as perfect lenses [2] while at much the same time the same author [3] has re-stimulated general interest in the idea of negative index materials-metals, with negative permittivities structured to give also negative permeabilities then lead consequentially to the possibility of 'cloaking' [4]. It is in this context of renewed interest in the optical properties of structured metal films that we here revisit the rather old problem of the transmissivity of unstructured films. There are various standard texts which give expressions for the transmissivity of a thin slab of any material. Stratton [5] gives the transmissivity T (Stratton p515 Eq. (24)) for normal incidence in air as: #100102-$15.00 USD},

In our work, optical properties of thin metals films deposited by thermal evaporation and low pressure (1.3310-5-1.3310-4 Pa) DC plasma sputtering were investigated. Such low pressure is provided by triode sputtering method which supports a ballistic type of mass transfer between the sputtering target and the substrate. This method enables fine control of the film thickness and its density. Comparison of the films deposited by mentioned above two methods on glass substrates shows significant differences in their optical and electrical properties.

The Haacke's figure of merit was used to determine the optimal thickness of 3 nm for those films produced, and a relative slope method was used along with fits to obtained data to determine a more precise optimum of 3.3 nm. Differences in transmittance and resistivity from other sources were attributed to the lesser degree of compacting in the deposition method used when compared to dc sputtering.

The internal optical electric field distribution inside the devices was calculated with the use of complex indices of refraction and layer thickness of the materials as determined by spectroscopic ellipsometry. Contributions to the photocurrent from optical absorption in polymer and fullerene layers were both necessary to model the experimental photocurrent action spectra. We obtained values for the exciton diffusion range of 4.7 and 7.7 nm for PEOPT and C60, respectively.

Thin gold nanoisland film shows surface plasmon resonance (SPR) peak in the visible wavelength range, which shifts to near infrared with an increase in the thickness of the film. It was found that thin film of gold consists of nanoparticles of different size and shape, particularly nanorods of noncylindrical shapes. Alinear relation was found between SPR peak wavelength and the aspect ratio of the nanoparticles in gold thin film. Effective medium refractive index of the gold film is estimated to be ∼2.5, which decreases with an increase in film thickness. The coating of dyes on gold films splits the SPR peak with an enhanced absorption. Enhancement in absorption of composite film is maximal when the dye absorption peak coincides with the SPR peak; otherwise enhancement in transmission is observed for all the wavelength range. Absorption amplitude of composite film peaks increase with an increase in the gold film thickness, which tend toward saturation for film thickness of ≥6 nm. A correlation shows that absorption spectra can be described by the Maxwell Garnett theory, when the gold nanoparticles have a nearly spherical shape for very thin film (≤6 nm). © 2012 Optical Society of America.},

   abstract = {Titanium thin films with nanometer thicknesses were deposited on polyethylene terephthalate (PET) substrate using the triode magnetron sputtering technique. It was observed that the titanium thin film-polymeric substrate set attenuates the energy of the incident electromagnetic wave in the frequency range of 8 to 12 GHz. This result allows to consider this set as a radar absorbing material, which may be employed in automobile, telecommunication, aerospace, medical, and electroelectronic areas. Results of the reflectivity show that the attenuation depends on the thin film thickness, as a determining factor. Thin films with 25 to 100 nm thickness values show attenuation of the electromagnetic wave energy from around 20 to 50%. Analyses by Rutherford backscattering spectrometry provided information about the thickness of the thin films studied. Hall effect analyses contributed to better understand the influence of the thin film thickness on the electron mobility and consequently on absorption properties.},

   abstract = {The optical transmission spectra of rf sputtered tungsten oxide films on glass substrates were modeled to determine absorption edge behavior, film thickness, and index of refraction. Removal of substrate reflection and absorption phenomena from the experimental spectra allowed direct examination of thin film optical characteristics. The interference fringe pattern allows determination of the film thickness and the dependence of the real index of refraction on wavelength. Knowledge of the interference fringe behavior in the vicinity of the absorption edge was found essential to unambiguous determination of the optical band gap. In particular, the apparently random deviations commonly observed in the extrapolation of as-acquired data are eliminated by explicitly considering interference fringe phenomena. The multivariable optimization fitting scheme employed allows air-film-substrate reflection losses to be compensated without making reflectance measurements.},

   abstract = {Polycrystalline titanium thin films have been widely employed as interlayer between the substrate and different coatings in order to improve adhesion strength, corrosion resistance and wear performance, as well as to promote the growth of crystalline phases of the coating. The thickness of the Ti layer can be relevant on the behavior of the coatings, however very few studies have been carried out. In this work, the crystal structure of polycrystal-line titanium films deposited with a vacuum arc discharge on monocrystalline silicon wafers (100) was studied and a dependence on the film thickness was found. The presence of the fcc phase of titanium was observed for the thinnest films with a critical thickness estimated in 300 nm, a much larger value than those reported for other deposition processes. For larger thicknesses, the films grew as α-titanium with a preferred orientation in the [100] direction. The obtained results agreed with a growth model based on the matching between the film and the substrate lattice. The characteristics of the films deposited in two steps, which had not been previously investigated , reinforced the suggested model.},

@article{Whiteside2016,
   abstract = {The proliferation of laser technologies has profoundly increased the demand for high-quality optical thin films whose physical properties are tunable and well defined. Such films are frequently deposited in thicknesses much shorter than the wavelengths of visible light and consequently present challenges for characterization by traditional microscopy. Metal films in particular exemplify these challenges, due to their broad range of refractive indices, optical absorption and often near-complete reflectivity in the visible spectrum. However, due to their relatively consistent crystalline structure, the bulk optical properties of metal thin films are chiefly dependent on their thickness. This review therefore presents a compendium of viable alternative characterization techniques to highlight their respective utilities, limitations and resolutions, specifically with regard to the characterization of the thickness of metal films. Furthermore, this review explicitly addresses the operating theories, methods and analyses relating to the five most predominantly utilized techniques: X-ray Reflectivity (XRR), Spectroscopic Ellipsometry (SE), Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Energy-Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDS). This work is intended as an introductory guide to thin film characterization modalities and their applicability for metal and optically-absorptive films, while also identifying AFM and SEM/EDS as being amongst the more reliable of the techniques.},

Uganda is abundantly rich in clay minerals such as ball clay, kaolin, feldspar, and quartz from which ceramic substrates were developed. Aluminium films of different thicknesses were deposited on different substrates in the diffusion pump microprocessor vacuum coater (Edwards AUTO 306). The optical reflectance of the aluminium films was obtained using a spectrophotometer (SolidSpec-3700/DUV-UV-VIS-NIR) at various wave lengths. The analysis of the results of the study revealed that the optical reflectance of the aluminium films was above 50% and increased with increasing film thickness and wavelength. Thus, this method can be used to produce reflector systems in the technology of solar cooking and other appliances which use solar energy.},

   abstract = {Reflectance is also important in telecommunication devices such as optical waveguides which function on total internal reflectance. In addition to waveguides, dense wavelength division multiplexing (DWDM) filters reflect over very narrow wavelength bands and are used to separate optical signals in telecommunication fiber optics. The list goes on…. In addition to improving performance and adding color, reflective coatings are also used to reduce the cost of a wide variety of materials. By applying reflective and color coatings, less expensive base materials can be used and lifetimes extended. Instead of using colored glass, architectural coatings can be applied to regular glass to obtain a range of colors not possible with the original substrates. Color shift coatings applied to currency and packaging have saved untold trillions of dollars in losses and theft. Obviously, reflective thin films are significantly less expensive than polishing metal surfaces, particularly on very large surfaces. By using DWDM filters, hundreds of optical signals can be propagated down a single fiber optics line instead of using separate fibers for each wavelength, thus saving cost of materials and installation. To this end, thin reflective films can (1) improve the reflectance of virtually any surface, (2) turn a diffuse surface into a reflecting surface, (3) significantly reduce materials costs by using less expensive base materials, (4) change the color of the surface or window, (5) significantly decrease wear and corrosion of a surface, (6) increase the functionality of a surface or optical element, (7) replace highly toxic chromium in mirrors, plumbing fixtures and hardware and (8) increase security of currency and packaging. What is Reflectivity? Reflectance, as defined in physics and optics, is the ratio of the energy of a wave reflected from a surface to the energy possessed by the wave striking the surface. Some materials are used for mirrors because they reflect all spectral components of white light with little absorption or transmission. Other materials appear colored because they selectively absorb in certain wavelength ranges and reflect the unabsorbed wavelength bands. Because reflectivity is a directional property, it depends critically on surface quality, and can be either specular or diffuse. As shown in Figures 1a and 1b, for specular surfaces, such as glass or highly polished metal, reflectivity will be nearly zero at all angles except at the reflected angle; i.e., other than for radiation normal to the surface; incident radiation is reflected at an angle equal to the angle of incidence (angle of reflection (θ R) = angle of incidence (θ i))},

   abstract = {Absorption spectra of gold nanoisland thin film and the composite film of gold having thin coating of Methylene Blue and Rh6G dyes have been studied. Thin gold nanoisland film shows surface plasmon resonance (SPR) peak in the visible wavelength range, which shifts to near infrared with an increase in the thickness of the film. It was found that thin film of gold consists of nanoparticles of different size and shape, particularly nanorods of noncylindrical shapes. Alinear relation was found between SPR peak wavelength and the aspect ratio of the nanoparticles in gold thin film. Effective medium refractive index of the gold film is estimated to be ∼2.5, which decreases with an increase in film thickness. The coating of dyes on gold films splits the SPR peak with an enhanced absorption. Enhancement in absorption of composite film is maximal when the dye absorption peak coincides with the SPR peak; otherwise enhancement in transmission is observed for all the wavelength range. Absorption amplitude of composite film peaks increase with an increase in the gold film thickness, which tend toward saturation for film thickness of ≥6 nm. A correlation shows that absorption spectra can be described by the Maxwell Garnett theory, when the gold nanoparticles have a nearly spherical shape for very thin film (≤6 nm). © 2012 Optical Society of America.},

The absorber features high absorption efficiency due to the low reflection off the structured surface and high absorption across the film thickness. The refractive index and extinction coefficient are extracted using spectroscopic ellipsometry. It is found that the single NiCr film exhibits an increasing refractive index as the gas atmosphere pressure increases, hence the three-layer gradient NiCr absorber can be fabricated by adjusting the gas atmosphere pressure during sputtering deposition. Essential Macleod software has been used to generate an efficient film structure design and the calculations show similar absorptance trend compared to the experimental measurement result. The results indicate that the gradient refractive structured metal thin film absorber can provide high absorption for applications in thermal sensing.},

XRD results showed that the structure of the deposited thin films changed from amorphous phase for the films, which deposited at room temperature, to crystalline phase for the films, which deposited at high temperature. Optimum temperature to obtain a good crystalline structure was 525°C. The SEM image also showed that the crystallization of the thin films is increased with increasing of annealing temperature. Transmittance and reflectance spectral were used to calculate the absorption coefficient. Two absorption edges in two spectral regions were distinguished according to direct and indirect electron transitions. Energy band gap E<inf>g</inf> was calculated by using the Tauc relationship for both direct and indirect electron transitions. The average value of E<inf>g</inf> was equal to 0.79 eV and 0.61 eV for direct and indirect transitions, respectively.},

The optical performance of microbolometer with NiCr has been compared with titanium (Ti) and without any metal thin-film. The comparison indicates that the optical absorption response of NiCr device is nearly flat and has a broadband enhancement over the LWIR range. In addition, it shows large insensitivity to variations in air-gap and metal thin-film thickness, which permits for a large fabrication tolerance. In addition, the optimized air-gap devices show that the NiCr-based device has the smallest air-gap thickness, which can lead to short leg-length and mechanically robust device.},

Deposition power was varied for suitable characteristics of films grown at various DC powers, i.e. 100 W, 150 W and 200 W. Thin Mo film of approximately 580 nm thickness was successfully grown at DC power of 100 W at room temperature.

XRD patterns revealed Mo films to be monocrystalline in nature and only one peak was observed corresponding to the (1 1 0)cub reflection plane at 2θ = 40.5°. Exceptionally dense microstructure was found for surface morphology observation by AFM and FESEM. Increasing deposition power resulted in coarser surface of the grown films. The minimum average surface roughness was found to be around 0.995 nm. Scotch tape adhesion test was performed to validate adhesion. Grown Mo films were found metallic in nature with electrical resistivity of 2.64 × 10−5 Ω-cm. Furthermore, it was found that by increasing deposition power, the electrical resistivity could further be reduced.},

There are, as yet, no data concerning its use in whole-body primary staging and its interobserver variability in patients with prostate cancer (PC) prior to therapy. Methods A search of our clinical database from April 2013 to May 2017 yielded 93 patients with histologically confirmed cancer in whom 99mTc-MIP-1404 SPECT/CT had been performed for primary whole-body staging before therapy. Whole-body planar and SPECT/CT images of the lower abdomen and thorax had been obtained 3 to 4 hours postinjection of 706 ± 72 MBq 99mTc-MIP-1404. Images were visually analyzed for extent and location of abnormal uptake by 2 experienced nuclear physicians. Interobserver agreement for detection of primary tumor and metastatic lesions was assessed. In addition, SUVs of prostate-specific membrane antigen-positive regions of the prostate were determined in all patients, and from these, a variable reflecting total tumor load in the prostate gland was calculated (TUprostate). Follow-up reports of subsequent therapeutic interventions were available in 52 (56%) of all patients with a median follow-up of 18 months. Results In 90 (97%) of 93 patients, prostate uptake above background was detected as correlate of the histologically diagnosed PC. Forty-eight lymph node and 29 bone metastases were detected in 16 and 9 patients, respectively. In addition, 3 patients had disseminated bone metastases. No distant organ metastases were found. Interobserver agreement was high for the overall scan result (97%), as well as for the detection of the primary tumor (97%), of lymph node metastases (97%), and of bone metastases (99%). Recurrence of PC occurred in 5 patients in whom follow-up was available (10%). TUprostate was significantly higher in patients with Gleason scores of 8 or greater compared with patients with Gleason scores of 7 or less and at prostate-specific antigen (PSA) serum levels of 10 ng/mL or greater compared with PSA serum levels of 10 ng/mL or less. TUprostate of greater than 26 in the primary tumor predicted the occurrence of lymph node or bone metastases with a sensitivity of 82% and specificity of 76%. Conclusions MIP-1404 SPECT/CT has a high accuracy and low interobserver variability in the diagnosis of PC and allows detection of lymph node and bone metastases in a significant proportion of as yet untreated PC patients. TUprostate is correlated with Gleason score and PSA serum concentration and allows prediction of the occurrence of lymph node and bone metastases with moderate accuracy at primary staging.},

We therefore wanted to assess the performance of 99mTc-trofolastat SPECT/CT in a phase 2 multicenter, multireader prospective study in patients with intermediate- and high-grade PCa, before radical prostatectomy and extended pelvic lymph node (LN) dissection, with histopathology as the gold standard. Methods: PCa patients (n = 105) with an increased risk of LN involvement (LNI) underwent pelvic 99mTc-trofolastat SPECT/CT before radical prostatectomy with extended pelvic LN dissection. The sensitivity of 99mTc-trofolastat for detection of PCa on a patient and lobe basis, using visual and semiquantitative (tumor-to-background ratio [TBR]) scores, and of LNI was evaluated as well as the correlation of uptake within the gland to Gleason scores (GS) and assessment of the predictive potential of 99mTc-trofolastat uptake for LNI. Results: PCa was detected in 98 patients (94%) with acceptable variability between readers. There was a significantly higher visual score and TBR in positive lobes compared with tumor-negative lobes. Receiver-operating characteristic analysis showed that visual scores more accurately discriminated lobes with GS # 3 1 3 from ≥ 3 1 4, whereas TBRs discriminated high-grade disease from normal lobes better. Visual scores and TBRs correlated significantly with GS. 99mTc-trofolastat SPECT/CT detected LNI with a sensitivity of 50% and specificity of 87%, and TBR values significantly predicted LNI with a sensitivity of 90%. Conclusion: 99mTc-trofolastat SPECT/CT detects PCa with high sensitivity in patients with intermediate- and high-risk PCa compared with histology. It has the potential to be used as a surrogate marker for GS and predict LNI.},

   abstract = {Background: Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA)–targeted positron emission tomography (PET) can visualize metastatic lesions in recurrent prostate cancer (PC). However, reliable identification of small and/or atypically localized lesions during salvage surgery procedures is challenging. Objective: To describe the technique, feasibility, and short-term outcomes of 99mTechnetium (99mTc)-based PSMA-radioguided surgery (99mTc-PSMA-RGS) for removal of recurrent PC lesions. Design, setting, and participants: Thirty-one consecutive patients with evidence of recurrent PC on 68Ga-PSMA N,N′-bis[2-hydroxy-5-(carboxyethyl)benzyl] ethylenediamine-N,N′-diacetic acid (68Ga-PSMA-11) PET after radical prostatectomy undergoing 99mTc-PSMA-RGS were retrospectively analyzed. Surgical procedure: Salvage surgery with intraoperative radioguidance using a gamma probe was performed after intravenous application of 99mTc-PSMA investigation and surgery (mean activity 571 MBq, mean time to surgery 19.7 h). Measurements: Radioactive rating (positive vs negative) of resected tissue was compared with the findings of postoperative histopathological analysis. Best prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response without additional treatment was determined after 8–16 wk postoperatively. Biochemical recurrence- and treatment-free survival was evaluated. Results and limitations: In total, 132 tissue specimens were removed, of which 58 showed metastatic involvement on histological analysis. On a specimen basis, radioactive rating yielded a sensitivity of 83.6% (confidence interval [CI]: 70.9–91.5%), a specificity of 100%, and an accuracy of 93.0% (CI: 85.5–96.7%). With 99mTc-PSMA-RGS, all lesions visualized on preoperative 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET could be removed. Moreover, 99mTc-PSMA-RGS detected additional metastases as small as 3 mm in two patients. Thirteen patients suffered from complications related to surgery (Clavien-Dindo grade 1: 12 patients; grade 3a: one patient). A PSA reduction below 0.2 ng/ml was observed in 20 patients. Thirteen patients remained biochemical recurrence free after a median follow-up of 13.8 (range: 4.6–18.3) mo. Twenty patients continued to be treatment free after a median follow-up of 12.2 (range: 5.5–18.3) mo. Conclusions: As a new technique for surgical guidance, 99mTc-PSMA-RGS is feasible, and has been proved to be of high value for successful intraoperative detection and removal of metastatic lesions in PC patients scheduled for salvage surgery. Its long-term impact on outcome has to be evaluated. Patient summary: In this report, we evaluated a novel technique to identify metastatic lesions intraoperatively in patients with recurrent prostate cancer to facilitate surgical removal. After intravenous injection of radioactive molecules that specifically bind to prostate cancer cells that show increased expression of the prostate-specific membrane antigen, we were able to detect and remove these metastatic lesions during surgery. Following salvage surgery, 41.9% of patients remained biochemical recurrence free (median follow-up of 13.8 mo) and 64.5% continued to be treatment free (median follow-up of 12.2 mo). 99mTechnetium-based prostate-specific membrane antigen–radioguided surgery as a new surgical technique is feasible, and has been proved to be of high value for successful intraoperative detection and removal of metastatic lesions in prostate cancer patients scheduled for salvage surgery. Its long-term impact on outcome has to be evaluated.},

The films were characterized by atomic force microscope, UV VIS NIR spectrophotometer, thickness profiler and nano mechanical testing system. The surface morphology of the film was examined by atomic force microscope shows the dense and uniform nanostructures with increased surface roughness from 4 to 21 nm with increasing argon flow. UV-VIS-NIR Spectrophotometer analysis indicates higher reflectance for all the films in the wavelength range of 250 nm to 2500 nm. Nano indentation study revealed that there was a considerable change in hardness values of the films prepared at different conditions.},

   abstract = {The anodic dissolution and passivation of pure aluminium in aqueous lithium carbonate/bicarbonate solutions has been researched using cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). Sweep rate studies revealed a wide anodic peak and the total absence of a reverse peak. Data comply with all criteria for diagnosis of totally irreversible systems. The number of electrons transferred and the transfer coefficient were estimated. The anodic process was shown to be under mixed control in the presence of oxygen, its removal causing a change to diffusion control with loss of passivation. Results were confirmed by EIS insofar as the diffusional and mixed character of reactions. Capacitance values of 20 and 1 μF cm-2 were found for the case of de-aerated and aerated solutions respectively. Protection is conferred only in the presence of oxygen with lithium incorporated into a thin film. As a result, the open circuit potential changed by about 1 V when compared to values obtained in the absence of lithium in the same experimental conditions. The film produced was found to be remarkably resistant to chloride ions attack. © 1992.},

We use low temperature deposition process, e.g., plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD), for depositing SiN. What we experienced is that the wet etching by using Tetramethyl Ammonium Hydroxide (TMAH-water) solution leads the failure of micromachining MEMS sensors and actuators. Damage of aluminum connection by the etching solution is found as the killer reason. In this paper, we have investigated the etching of Al in different TMAH solutions. The result shows that due to deposition of SiN after Al metallization, pinholes are always formed on SiN because of the Al crystal hillocks formed during the SiN deposition. The edge of the Al pattern is not perfectly covered because of poor step coverage of PECVD SiN on Al. The in situ method for passivation of the aluminum during the wet etching has been-used. By adding the surfactants, the passivation technique for Al during the Si micromachining in TMAH-water solution is achieved. The quality of Si anisotropic wet etching which includes etching rate, surface roughness and undercutting have been affected significantly.},

Comparison of electropolished aluminum and sputtering-deposited aluminum substrates revealed greatly increased rates of coating growth associated with an enrichment of copper impurity in the electropolished substrate that was revealed by transmission electron microscopy. With respect to chromium chemistry in a developed coating, the presence of dissolved oxygen and long conversion treatment times promoted the formation of Cr(VI) species that are generated by oxidation of Cr(III) species.

Thermal stress originated from difference in CTE and temperature variation during and after sputtering seems to be a main factor in room temperature sputter deposited aluminum films. From observation of temperature-stress behavior, it was found that the pure aluminum film has an elastic modulus of 56GPa and compressive yield strength of -100MPa. The yield strength was improved to about -175MPa by alloying with 3wt.%Ti. Titanium alloying also proved to be useful in extending linear elastic region before plastic deformation occurs. However, it was hard to determine the stress level with buckling phenomena of ring/beam microstructures because of imperfections such as stress gradient and thermal deformation. In stead, those diagnostic microstructures could be applied to give an information on whether a plastic deformation was introduced or not in a structure of specific dimension.},

A new biochip consisting of an array of microelectrodes with fully-integrated analog and digital circuitry realized in an industrial CMOS process addresses these issues. The device is capable of on-chip signal filtering for improved signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), on-chip analog and digital conversion, and multiplexing, thereby facilitating simultaneous stimulation and recording of electrogenic cell activity. The designed electrode pitch of 250 m significantly limits the space available for circuitry: a repeated unit of circuitry associated with each electrode comprises a stimulation buffer and a bandpass filter for readout. The bandpass filter has corner frequencies of 100 Hz and 50 kHz, and a gain of 1000. Stimulation voltages are generated from an 8-bit digital signal and converted to an analog signal at a frequency of 120 kHz. Functionality of the read-out circuitry is demonstrated by the measurement of cardiomyocyte activity. The microelectrode is realized in a shifted design for flexibility and biocompatibility.

   abstract = {The use of cell-based biosensors outside of the laboratory has been limited due to many issues including preparation of the sample, maintenance of the biological environment, and integration of the electronics for data collection and analysis. This paper describes a system that addresses several of these issues with the development of an integrated silicon-polydimethylsiloxane cell-cartridge. The cell-cartridge contains a CMOS silicon chip that incorporates a digital interface, temperature control system, microelectrode electrophysiology sensors, and analog signal buffering. Additionally, the cell-cartridge supports two separate cell populations in two 10 ml sealed chambers that have independent fluidic channels for sample injection. A portable, microcontroller-based electronics system capable of monitoring the action potential (AP) activity within the cell-cartridges was also developed. The AP activities of cardiomyocyte syncytia in the two chambers differentially responded to the flow of a control medium versus the flow of a biochemical agent. The cell-cartridges and portable electronics system were used to successfully record AP activity from cardiomyocytes outside of the laboratory under realistic application conditions.},

   abstract = {We report the realization of electrical coupling between neurons and depletion type floating gate (FG) p-channel MOS transistors. The devices were realized in a shortened 0.5 μm CMOS technology. Increased boron implant dose was used to form the depletion type devices. Post-CMOS processing steps were added to expose the devices sensing area. The neurons are coupled to the polycrystalline silicon (PS) FG through 420 Å thermal oxide in an area which is located over the thick field oxide away from the transistor. The combination of coupling area pad having a diameter of 10 or 15 μm and sensing transistor with W/L of 50/0.5 μm results in capacitive coupling ratio of the neuron signal of about 0.5 together with relatively large transistor transconductance. The combination of the FG structure with a depletion type device, leads to the following advantages. (a) No need for dc bias between the solution in which the neurons are cultured and the transistor with expected consequences to the neuron as well as the silicon die durability. (b) The sensing area of the neuron activity is separated from the active area of the transistor. Thus, it is possible to design the sensing area and the channel area separately. (c) The channel area, which is the most sensitive part of the transistor, can be insulated and shielded from the ionic solution in which the neurons are cultured. (d) There is an option to add a switching transistor to the FG and use the FG also for the neuron stimulation. © 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Specifically, the effects of film composition, deposition temperature, and underlayer on hillock formation were investigated. The film compositions included pure Al, Al with 1.5 wt.% Cu (or AlCu), AlCu with 0.2 wt.% W, and AlCu with 0.4 wt.% W. These films were sputter deposited at 300 "C and 450 "C on either oxide-or Ti-W-coated Si substrates. Following deposition, the films were annealed in air for 20 mitt at 450 "C. For all film compositions, the deposition temperature had the most significant effect on the hillock density. For a given deposition temperature, the addition of Cu to pure Al drastically reduced the hillock density, but the addition of W to AlCu increased the hillock density. The effect of the underlayer on the hillock density was negligible. Cross-sections of the hillocks showed that they were solid from the bottom interface to the top surface, and no voids were found near the hillocks. The grain size did not have a significant effect on the hillock density. However, a correlation between increasing (111) film texture and decreasing hillock density was observed.},

Hillock growth occurs after annealing of the films in the form of aluminum projections normal to the film surface. The growth of these hillocks (as well as depressions) takes place during the heating and cooling portions of the annealing cycle caused by differences in expansion coefficient between film and substrate. Diffusional creep (with grain boundary diffusion) or grain boundary sliding is believed to occur in these films to relieve the thermally induced stresses which result in annealing hillocks and depressions.

The produced dielectric PAA structures, featuring cylindrical nano-pores of very high aspect ratio (> 100), are useful for several applications including the production of nanowires and miniature MEMS packages. The fabrication process utilizes a photoresist mask; but to overcome the instability of the photoresist during the anodization process, special borderlines are included in the mask design. These borderlines act as self-synchronized switches for the anodization current, preventing the undesired photoresist delamination and lateral extension of the PAA structures. Employing such borderlines resulted in a reduction of the lateral extension of masked Al anodization on 200 mm wafers from more than 300μm to approximately 6 μm.},

To optimize the bi-layer overhang formation, we have examined the undercut formation kinetics of LOR bottom layer and the dependence of the SiO 2 sputter-deposition lift-off processed electrode structure on the undercut length. Crater-shaped and recessed electrode structure is obtained when the undercut length is short (#2 mm) and longer than 3 mm, respectively. To optimize the SiO 2 sputter-deposition process, we have examined the dependence of Au electrode passivation on the SiO 2 sputtering parameters in terms of electrochemical cyclic-voltammogram (CV), impedance, electrical noise, sputter-deposition rate and in vitro neuronal activity recording property. The MEAs passivated under pure argon supply condition showed poor barrier properties, poor neuronal signal recording performance, and cytotoxic property. The CV of MEAs passivated under oxygen mixing ratios above 5% showed traditional sigmoidal CV and long-term recording of neuronal activities, probing the excellent barrier property and cytocompatibility of the SiO 2 films sputter-deposited under oxygen mixing conditions. We have also issued thermal damaging aspect of bi-layer overhang structure which is tightly coupled with the detailed electrode structure and the high sputter-deposition rate. Finally, it was suggested that measurement of CV, electrochemical impedance and electrical noise can be a viable tool in evaluating the barrier performance of a passivation layer.},

These channels feature noise values of 2.4 μV\rm rms in the action-potential band (300 Hz-10 kHz) and 5.4 μV\rm rms in the local-field-potential band (1 Hz-300 Hz), and provide programmable gain (up to 78 dB) to accommodate various biological preparations.

This paper presents a TMAH-water based etching recipe to achieve high silicon etch rate, a smooth etched surface and almost total protection of the exposed aluminum metallization. The etch rate measurements of (100) silicon, silicon dioxide and aluminum along with the morphology studies of etched surfaces are performed on both n-type and p-type silicon wafers at different concentrations (2, 5, 10 and 15%) for undoped TMAH treated at various temperatures as well as for TMAH solution doped separately and simultaneously with silicic acid and ammonium peroxodisulphate (AP). It is established through a detailed study that 5% TMAH-water solution dual doped with 38 gm/l silicic acid and 7 gm/l AP yields a reasonably high (100) silicon etch rate of 70 μm/h at 80 °C, very small etch rates of SiO2 and pure aluminum (around 80 Å/h and 50 Å/h, respectively), and a smooth surface (±7 nm) at a bath temperature of 80 °C. The etchant has been successfully used for fabricating several MEMS structures like piezoresistive accelerometer, vaporizing liquid micro-thruster and flow sensor. In all cases, the bulk micromachining is carried out after the formation of aluminum interconnects which is found to remain unaffected during the prolonged etching process at 80 °C.

Hillock formation in the Al film was found to be strongly dependent on the preheat temperature in the range of 100°-300°C and less on the annealing temperature. Hillock size and density were significantly increased when aluminum was sputtered on silicon dioxide layer. Sputtered Al films were used as the etch mask for micromachining of (100) silicon and were studied as a function of etch temperature, time and the addition of ammonium peroxodisulfate (AP) into the anisotropic etchant consisting of 5%TMAH-water+1.5% dissolved silicon. Aluminium mask exhibited excellent etch selectivity, comparable to the silicon dioxide or silicon nitride etch mask. © 2006 IEEE.},

However, Al 2 O 3 incorporation into the film significantly decreased the residual impurities despite of a low growth temperature. The decrease in C impurity is attributed to the reduced oxygen vacancies by the incorporated Al 2 O 3 phase or the high reactivity of Al precursor. Consequently, the electronic band structure of the film, and thereby the electrical properties were improved significantly.},

   abstract = {Background: Due to increasing aging of population prevalence of age-related disorders including osteoporosis is rapidly growing. Due to health and economic impact of the disease, there is an urgent need to develop techniques supporting bone metabolism and bone regeneration after fracture. Due to imbalance between bone forming and bone resorbing cells, the healing process of osteoporotic bone is problematic and prolonged. Thus searching for agents able to restore the homeostasis between these cells is strongly desirable. Results: In the present study, using ALD technology, we obtained homogeneous, amorphous layer of hafnium (IV) oxide (HfO 2). Considering the specific growth rate (1.9Å/cycle) for the selected process at the temperature of 90 °C, we performed the 100 nm deposition process, which was confirmed by measuring film thickness using reflectometry. Then biological properties of the layer were investigated with pre-osteoblast (MC3T3), pre-osteoclasts (4B12) and macrophages (RAW 264.7) using immunofluorescence and RT-qPCR. We have shown, that HfO 2 (i) enhance osteogen-esis, (ii) reduce osteoclastogenesis (iii) do not elicit immune response and (iv) exert anti-inflammatory effects. Conclusion: HfO 2 layer can be applied to cover the surface of metallic biomaterials in order to enhance the healing process of osteoporotic bone fracture.},

   abstract = {Hafnium dioxide (HfO2) is attracting attention for bio-related applications due to its good cytocompatibility, high density, and resistance to corrosion and mechanical damage. Here we synthesize two types of hafnium-oxide thin films on substrates via self-organized electrochemical anodization: (1) an array of hierarchically structured nanorods anchored to a thin oxide layer and (2) a microscopically flat oxide film. The nanostructured film is composed of a unique mixture of HfO2, suboxide Hf2O3, and oxide-hydroxide compound HfO2·nH2O whereas the flat film is mainly HfO2. In vitro interaction of the two films with MG-63 osteoblast-like cells and Gram-negative E. coli bacteria is studied for the first time to assess the potential of the films for biomedical application. Both films reveal good cytocompatibility and affinity for proteins, represented by fibronectin and especially albumin, which is absorbed in a nine times larger amount. The morphology and specific surface chemistry of the nanostructured film cause a two-fold enhanced antibacterial effect, better cell attachment, significantly improved proliferation of cells, five-fold rise in the cellular Young's modulus, slightly stronger production of reactive oxygen species, and formation of cell clusters. Compared with the flat film, the nanostructured one features the weakening of AFM-measured adhesion force at the cell/surface interface, probably caused by partially lifting the nanorods from the substrate due to the strong contact with cells. The present findings deepen the understanding of biological processes at the living cell/metal-oxide interface, underlying the role of surface chemistry and the impact of nanostructuring at the nanoscale.},

   abstract = {Nano-sized hafnium oxide (HfO 2) particles are being considered for applications within the semiconductor industry. However, little is known about their cytotoxicity. The objective of this work was to assess several HfO 2 nanoparticles (NPs) samples for their acute cytotoxicity. Dynamic light scattering analysis of the samples indicated that the average particle size of the HfO 2 in aqueous dispersions was in the sub-micron range with a fraction of particles having nano-dimensions. The media used in the toxicity assays decreased or increased the average particle size of HfO 2 NPs due to dispersion or agglomeration. Static time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS) revealed numerous surface contaminants on the NPs. Only one HfO 2 sample caused moderate cytotoxicity to human cell lines. The inhibitory sample caused a 50% response in the Live/Dead assay with HaCaT skin cells at 2200 mg L-1 ; and a 50% response in the mitochondrial toxicity test at 300 mg L-1. A microbial inhibition assay based on methano-genic activity also revealed that another HFO 2 sample caused moderate inhibition. The difference in toxicity between samples could not be attributed to size. Instead the difference in toxicity was likely due to differences in the contaminants of the HfO 2. The ToF-SIMS analysis indicated unique signatures of Br and P in the sample toxic to human cell lines suggesting a distinct synthesis was used for that sample which may have been accompanied by inhibitory impurities. The results taken as a whole indicate that HfO 2 itself is relatively non-toxic.},

The main advantage of SPECT/CT is the increased specificity achieved through a more precise localization and characterization of functional findings. The improved diagnostic accuracy is also associated with greater diagnostic confidence and better inter-specialty communication. Methods: This review presents a critical assessment of the relevant literature published so far on the role of SPECT/CT in a variety of clinical conditions. It also includes an update on the established evidence demonstrating both the advantages and limitations of this modality. Conclusions: For the majority of applications, SPECT/CT should be a routine imaging technique, fully integrated into the clinical decision-making process, including oncology, endocrinology, orthopaedics, paediatrics, and cardiology. Large-scale prospective studies are lacking, however, on the use of SPECT/CT in certain clinical domains such as neurology and lung disorders. The review also presents data on the complementary role of SPECT/CT with other imaging modalities and a comparative analysis, where available.},

   abstract = {In the era when positron emission tomography (PET) seems to constitute the most advanced application of nuclear medicine imaging, still the conventional procedure of single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) is far from being obsolete, especially if combined with computed tomography (CT). In fact, this dual modality imaging technique (SPECT/CT) lends itself to a wide variety of useful diagnostic applications whose clinical impact is in most instances already well established, while the evidence is growing for newer applications. The increasing availability of new hybrid SPECT/CT devices with advanced technology offers the opportunity to shorten acquisition time and to provide accurate attenuation correction and fusion imaging. In this review we analyse and discuss the capabilities of SPECT/CT for improving sensitivity and specificity in the imaging of both oncological and non-oncological diseases. The main advantages of SPECT/CT are represented by better attenuation correction, increased specificity, and accurate depiction of the localization of disease and of possible involvement of adjacent tissues. Endocrine and neuroendocrine tumours are accurately localized and characterized by SPECT/CT, as also are solitary pulmonary nodules and lung cancers, brain tumours, lymphoma, prostate cancer, malignant and benign bone lesions, and infection. Furthermore, hybrid SPECT/CT imaging is especially suited to support the increasing applications of minimally invasive surgery, as well as to precisely define the diagnostic and prognostic profile of cardiovascular patients. Finally, the applications of SPECT/CT to other clinical disorders or malignant tumours is currently under extensive investigation, with encouraging results in terms of diagnostic accuracy. © Springer-Verlag 2010.},

   abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-α-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 Å for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

   abstract = {Although not yet developed at the commercial stage, nuclear fusion technology is still being considered as a very promising solution for the coverage of the future global energy needs. This is mainly due to its environmental acceptability, and to the fact that, contrary to nuclear fission, its by-products cannot be used in nuclear warfare. Since research in nuclear fusion for the production of energy started about 60 years ago, the most studied reaction has been the fusion of tritium with deuterium, which produces very energetic neutrons (17.5 MeV). For this reaction to occur, the reactants have to be at extremely high temperatures (several hundred million degrees), constituting a plasma that has to be simultaneously maintained and confined. In this chapter, we study the steps that are needed for the construction of nuclear fusion reactors able to maintain these self-sustained plasmas. The most developed reactors are the magnetically confined Tokamak at the ITER (Cadarache, France) and the inertially confined system located at the Lawrence Livermore Laboratory in the USA. It is important to remark that in spite of all the research efforts devoted to nuclear fusion, it is estimated that it will still take a few decades for this technology to be available at the utility scale. © Springer-Verlag London 2013.},

   abstract = {Conventional CCD detectors have two major disadvantages: they are slow to read out and they suffer from read noise. These problems combine to make high-speed spectroscopy of faint targets the most demanding of astronomical observations. It is possible to overcome these weaknesses by using electron-multiplying CCDs (EMCCDs). EMCCDs are conventional frame-transfer CCDs, but with an extended serial register containing high-voltage electrodes. An avalanche of secondary electrons is produced as the photon-generated electrons are clocked through this register, resulting in signal amplification that renders the read noise negligible. Using a combination of laboratory measurements with the QUCAM2 EMCCD camera and Monte Carlo modelling, we show that it is possible to significantly increase the signal-to-noise ratio of an observation by using an EMCCD, but only if it is optimized and utilized correctly. We also show that even greater gains are possible through the use of photon counting. We present a recipe for astronomers to follow when setting up a typical EMCCD observation which ensures that maximum signal-to-noise ratio is obtained. We also discuss the benefits that EMCCDs would bring if used with the next generation of extremely large telescopes. Although we mainly consider the spectroscopic use of EMCCDs, our conclusions are equally applicable to imaging.},

The ultra-low noise, high resolution, high-quantum efficiency, and robustness to over exposure make these sensors ideally suited to applications traditionally served by image intensifiers. One important performance parameter of such low-light imaging systems is the noise introduced by the gain process. This work investigates the noise introduced by the electron multiplication within the EMCCD. The theory and measurements of the excess noise factor are presented. The measurement technique for determining the excess noise factor is described in detail. The results show that the noise performance matches that of the ideal staircase avalanche photodiode.

   abstract = {Background: Surgery is the cornerstone of treatment for many solid tumours. A wide variety of imaging modalities are available before surgery for staging, although surgeons still rely primarily on visual and haptic cues in the operating environment. Image and molecular guidance might improve the adequacy of resection through enhanced tumour definition and detection of aberrant deposits. Intraoperative modalities available for image-and molecular-guided cancer surgery are reviewed here. Methods: Intraoperative cancer detection techniques were identified through a systematic literature search, with selection of peer-reviewed publications from January 2012 to January 2017. Modalities were reviewed, described and compared according to 25 predefined characteristics. To summarize the data in a comparable way, a three-point rating scale was applied to quantitative characteristics. Results: The search identified ten image-and molecular-guided surgery techniques, which can be divided into four groups: conventional, optical, nuclear and endogenous reflectance modalities. Conventional techniques are the most well known imaging modalities, but unfortunately have the drawback of a defined resolution and long acquisition time. Optical imaging is a real-time modality; however, the penetration depth is limited. Nuclear modalities have excellent penetration depth, but their intraopera-tive use is limited by the use of radioactivity. Endogenous reflectance modalities provide high resolution, although with a narrow field of view. Conclusion: Each modality has its strengths and weaknesses; no single technique will be suitable for all surgical procedures. Strict selection of modalities per cancer type and surgical requirements is required as well as combining techniques to find the optimal balance.},

   abstract = {Background: Evaluation of lymph node (LN) status is an important factor for detecting metastasis and thereby staging breast cancer. Currently utilized clinical techniques involve the surgical disruption and resection of lymphatic structure, whether nodes or axillary contents, for histological examination. While reasonably effective at detection of macrometastasis, the majority of the resected lymph nodes are histologically negative. Improvements need to be made to better detect micrometastasis, minimize or eliminate lymphatic disruption complications, and provide immediate and accurate intraoperative feedback for in vivo cancer staging to better guide surgery. Methods: We evaluated the use of optical coherence tomography (OCT), a high-resolution, real-time, label-free imaging modality for the intraoperative assessment of human LNs for metastatic disease in patients with breast cancer. We assessed the sensitivity and specificity of double-blinded trained readers who analyzed intraoperative OCT LN images for presence of metastatic disease, using co-registered post-operative histopathology as the gold standard. Results: Our results suggest that intraoperative OCT examination of LNs is an appropriate real-time, label-free, non-destructive alternative to frozen-section analysis, potentially offering faster interpretation and results to empower superior intraoperative decision-making. Conclusions: Intraoperative OCT has strong potential to supplement current post-operative histopathology with real-time in situ assessment of LNs to preserve both non-cancerous nodes and their lymphatic vessels, and thus reduce the associated risks and complications from surgical disruption of lymphoid structures following biopsy.},

Hafnium Oxide (HfO2) based nanoagent has been used in clinical trials for radiosensitized tumor therapy. However, the current reported clinically used HfO2 nanoparticles are relay on intratumoral injectable, and the unmodified HfO2 nanoparticles tend to be aggregated in serum and cannot be injected by intravenous route, which significantly limited the types of treatable cancer. To overcome the limitation, in this work, we developed a large-scalable, intravenously injectable, and clearable HfO2 nanoassemblies (NAs) to enhance the radiotherapeutic effects. The HfO2 NAs exhibited meaningfully promoted free-radical generation upon X-ray radiation for cancer cell killing due to the improved the sensitiveness of the breast cancer cells. The PEGylated HfO2 NAs demonstrated efficient tumor-homing ability via intravenous injection and manifested by HfO2 NAs enhanced CT imaging in a 4T1 breast tumor model. Utilizing the radiation sensitization function of HfO2 NAs, excellent tumor killing efficacy was achieved via both intratumoral and intravenously injection administration. Importantly, our HfO2 NAs could be degraded and excreted efficiently in a reasonable period in living body and avoid long-term toxicity. Taken together, our work provides a new technique by an injectable CT imaging-guided radio-sensitivitiable nanosystem for the further potential clinic translation.},

   abstract = {We report a new low-temperature (280°C) parylene-C wafer bonding technique, where O 2 plasma-treated parylene-C bonds directly to Si 3 N 4 with an average bonding strength of 23 MPa. The technique works for silicon wafers with nitride surface and uses a single layer of parylene-C deposited only on one wafer. Microfluidic devices fabricated with this technology demonstrate a burst pressure as high as 16 MPa, while electrode structures remain functional after bonding. Using this technique , microfluidic structures can easily be formed by direct bonding to the nitride passivation layer of CMOS devices without any additional processing. INTRODUCTION Attempts to realize CMOS-integrated microfluidic devices have been made aiming to reduce microfabrication and packaging costs. However, traditional footprints of microfluidic devices have been an order-of-magnitude larger than that of CMOS devices and integration of these two technologies generally is difficult [1-3], packaging and integration constituting major costs. Hybrid integration requires low-temperature bonding without any processing on the CMOS side, which is not achievable for anodic, eutectic or fusion bonding. Moreover, microfluidic footprints should be reduced to that of CMOS chips to economize on CMOS costs, which can be done by high pressure-resistant microfluidics, implying shorter and narrower channels for a given fluidic throughput. Consequently, a post-CMOS bonding technique 1) that is high-strength and enables high pressure-resistant devices, 2) that can be performed at a sufficiently low temperature for keeping metal integrity, and 3) that can use directly the passivation layer with minimal post-processing, can be an important enabling technology for CMOS-microfluidics integration.},

Since parylene C is deposited directly on the substrate from the vapor phase it can conform to a wide range of geometries. However, the thickness of the deposited layer tends to decrease in microscale gaps, which might lead to an insulation failure. To ensure more robustness of the coating, the changes in parylene C coating thickness have been investigated experimentally using simple gaps of known dimensions. In an attempt to better understand these experimental findings, two theoretical models have been developed. The first one, which is based on a diffusion approximation, is able to reproduce and extrapolate the experimental results, leading to a useful design rule for practical applications involving parylene C coating. As an example, we present the substrate design of a flexible sieve electrode for a peripheral nerve interface. The second model aims at an appropriate microscopic description of the coating process in terms of kinetic theory of gases. © 2006 IEEE.},

   abstract = {Thanks to the excellent barrier property and fabrication accessibility, Parylene has been actively used in the microelec-tromechanical system. An ultra-thin Parylene film with thickness smaller than 100 nm is usually required to precisely tune the surface property of substrate or protect the functional unit. The commercially available regular Parylene deposition is a dimer mass determined chemical vapor deposition process with a high output (i.e. a low deposition precision in term of thickness control), around 1.6 μm/g (the ratio of film thickness to the loaded dimer mass) for the machine in the author's lab. Therefore, it is hard to controllably and reliably prepare a Parylene film with thickness smaller than 100 nm, which requires a dimer mass less than 62.5 mg. This paper reported a method to prepare ultra-thin Parylene films with the nominal thickness down to 1 nm. A home-made deposition chamber was put inside and connected with the regular machine chamber through a microfabricated orifice with feature size smaller than 1 mm. According to the free molecular flow theory, the pressure inside the deposition chamber can be predictably and con-trollably reduced, thereby an ultra-low output of Parylene deposition, as low as 0.08 nm/g, was successfully obtained. The deposition precision was increased by 4 orders of magnitude compared to that of a direct Parylene deposition. This highly controllable and reliable ultra-thin Parylene deposition technique will find promising applications in flexible electronics and biomedical microdevices.

Fabricating high-quality embedded image sensors with CMOS technologies is not a straightforward task. This motivates the study of CMOS technologies for imaging applica- tions presented in this thesis. The major content of this study can be partitioned into four parts: (a) A two-stage charac- terization methodology is developed for sensor optimization, including the characteriza- tion of large-area photodiodes and comparative analyses on small-dimension sensor arrays with various pixel structures, junction types of the sensors, and other process-related con- ditions. (b) The mechanism of hot-carrier induced excess minority carriers occurred at the in-pixel transistors is identified and investigated. The influence of the excess carriers on imager performance is analyzed. Suggestions on the pixel design are provided. (c) Signal cross-talk between adjacent pixels is quantified and studied using a sensor array with a specially designed metal shield pattern, which exposes the center pixel and covers the oth- ers. The influence of cross-talk on color imager performance is analyzed. Process and lay- out improvements on cross-talk are also proposed.

   abstract = {Background: Surgical oncology is still one of the main treatments for curing cancer. For a successful surgery however, a clean and radical resection is required. This can only be obtained if there is precise knowledge on were the tumor is situated and what parts of the tissue are malignant and which are not. To localize a tumor a lot of techniques are available. Peroperative determination if a tissue is malignant or benign is still a challenge. To be able to do this a technique is required that is fast, implementable in the OR and foremost is tumor specific. Cerenkov Luminescence Imaging (CLI) combines optical imaging with tumor specific PET tracers such as 18F-FDG. Within biological tissue these tracers send out a very faint luminescence which can be detected with highly sensitive EMCCD cameras. This will make it a promising technique that might be able to visualize tumors during surgery. Purpose: In this study we are trying to determine if CLI is a feasible technique for peroperative tumor visualization. Methods: Different in vitro studies are performed to determine the characteristics of Cerenkov luminescence and to predict the sensitivity of CLI. Different cameras have been tested to be able to come up with the best CLI setup with the highest sensitivity. The technique was tested in 5 subjects who had a superficial tumor and subsequently had undergone an 18F-FDG PET/CT scan. Images with the CLI setup, containing an EMCCD camera, where made 4 cm from the skin where the tumor was situated. Thereafter the obtained images were processed to see if the Cerenkov light from the tumor was detected. Results: We were able to visualize an activity of 3.5 kBq/ml in vivo. On average a tumor takes up around 10 kBq/ml. However, the biological tissue absorbs the majority of the light. We were not able to detect any light coming from the 18F-FDG during the in vivo studies. Conclusion: Image guided surgery based on Cerenkov Imaging is theoretically very promising. However, the reality is that the intensities of the signal are too weak to use for in vivo imaging during surgery.},

Cherenkov imaging allows for direct optical visualization of radiation dose deposition as ionizing beams pass through dielectric material via the Cherenkov Effect, by which fast-moving charged particles excite optical emission from media as they relax after rapid polarization. The number of Cherenkov photons produced is proportional to radiation dose delivered for a monoenergetic beam. However, the number of photons that can be detected is governed by efficiency in reaching the detector, which is influenced by variation in tissue optical properties in living subjects. This thesis first focuses on clinical patient imaging requirements, and techniques to improve the correlation between detected Cherenkov light intensity and metrics relating to delivered dose. Patients undergoing whole-breast radiotherapy (WBI), volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT), and total skin electron therapy (TSET) are discussed.    Quality assurance imaging is more straightforward, since the optical properties of the irradiated subject can be controlled. The remainder of this thesis employs water tanks and solid plastics to measure relative dose optically. These methods are adapted to accommodate atypical large field setups for TSET, as well as cutting edge clinical systems combining concurrent magnetic resonance imaging with radiotherapy delivery systems (cobalt-60 and linac based).},

   abstract = {This thesis presents research into ultra-low noise photonic microwave syn- thesis and the development of a novel, frequency comb-based, fibre optic time transfer technique. The focus in the first area is on reducing the noise introduced in the optical- to-electrical conversion process using balanced optical-microwave phase de- tectors. Two mainly free-space and two mainly fibre-based devices were built and their performance was characterised. The phase noise of the optical-to- electrical conversion of the free-space device was −119dBcHz−1 at 1Hz and −143dBcHz−1 at 20kHz from an 8GHz carrier which is the best perfor- mance reported for a free-space balanced-optical microwave phase detector. The improved fibre-based set-ups demonstrated a state-of-the-art amplitude- to-phase noise suppression of 60dB and a phase noise of the optical-to- electrical conversion of −131dBcHz−1 at 1Hz and −148Hz at 20kHz from an 8GHz carrier. The novel time transfer technique developed in the second part superimposes timing information onto the optical pulse train of an ITU-channel-filtered frequency comb using an intensity modulation scheme. Time transfer over a 50km long, delay-stabilised fibre spool produced a state-of-the-art time deviation of 300 fs and an accuracy of approximately 0.01 ns which is close to the best performance achieved using amplitude modulated cw lasers. Us- ing this technique on a 159km long installed fibre link between NPL and Reading, the same time deviation was achieved and an accuracy of approx- imately 0.08 ns was obtained, limited by uncertainty of the time interval counter. Using the same fibre link, microwave frequency transfer of the ITU-channel-filtered comb was demonstrated with a fractional frequency in- stability of 2×10−17 at 5000 s which is approximately at the same level as the best previously reported results which were obtained with a 30nm wide optical frequency comb},

The effective surface recombination velocity (Seff, max) ~ 10 cm/s is achieved at intermediate bulk injection levels with thermal ALD deposited HfO2 (top)/Al2O3 (bottom) bilayer system on n-type silicon with individual layer thickness between 3 and 7 nm. The best realized Seff,max value is lower by a factor of ~ 2.5 with respect to the single Al2O3 layer of similar thickness deposited under the same experimental conditions. The improved field effect passivation is quantified by enhanced effective charge density for the bilayer system in comparison with the corresponding value for single Al2O3 layer. The introduction of extra trap centers at the interface of the bilayer system is primarily responsible for the enriched field effect passivation, however, the sequence of the dielectric layers is important.},

However, up to a load of 30 N, crushing, cracking, and delamination of the Al2O3/glass system not occurs. The tribological experiments revealed a significant difference in the wear between the HfO2 and Al2O3 films. The microcrystalline structure observed for HfO2 resulted in better tribological properties than the Al2O3 film. The addition of a thin zinc oxide interlayer significantly improved the mechanical properties of the system with HfO2 film.},

The mechanical properties of films change as a function of composition and structure, which accordingly vary with deposition temperature and post-annealing. This work describes elastic modulus, hardness, and wear resistance of as-grown and annealed HfO 2 . From nanoindentation measurements, the elastic modulus and hardness remained relatively stable in the range of 163-165 GPa and 8.3-9.7 GPa as a function of deposition temperature. The annealing of HfO 2 caused significant increase in hardness up to 14.4 GPa due to film crystallization and densification. The structural change also caused increase in the elastic modulus up to 197 GPa. Wear resistance did not change as a function of deposition temperature, but improved upon annealing.},

   abstract = {© 2018 Author(s). The issue of stress in thin films and functional coatings is a persistent problem in materials science and technology that has congregated many efforts, both from experimental and fundamental points of view, to get a better understanding on how to deal with, how to tailor, and how to manage stress in many areas of applications. With the miniaturization of device components, the quest for increasingly complex film architectures and multiphase systems and the continuous demands for enhanced performance, there is a need toward the reliable assessment of stress on a submicron scale from spatially resolved techniques. Also, the stress evolution during film and coating synthesis using physical vapor deposition (PVD), chemical vapor deposition, plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD), and related processes is the result of many interrelated factors and competing stress sources so that the task to provide a unified picture and a comprehensive model from the vast amount of stress data remains very challenging. This article summarizes the recent advances, challenges, and prospects of both fundamental and applied aspects of stress in thin films and engineering coatings and systems, based on recent achievements presented during the 2016 Stress Workshop entitled "Stress Evolution in Thin Films and Coatings: from Fundamental Understanding to Control." Evaluation methods, implying wafer curvature, x-ray diffraction, or focused ion beam removal techniques, are reviewed. Selected examples of stress evolution in elemental and alloyed systems, graded layers, and multilayer-stacks as well as amorphous films deposited using a variety of PVD and PECVD techniques are highlighted. Based on mechanisms uncovered by in situ and real-time diagnostics, a kinetic model is outlined that is capable of reproducing the dependence of intrinsic (growth) stress on the grain size, growth rate, and deposited energy. The problems and solutions related to stress in the context of optical coatings, inorganic coatings on plastic substrates, and tribological coatings for aerospace applications are critically examined. This review also suggests strategies to mitigate excessive stress levels from novel coating synthesis perspectives to microstructural design approaches, including the ability to empower crack-based fabrication processes, pathways leading to stress relaxation and compensation, as well as management of the film and coating growth conditions with respect to energetic ion bombardment. Future opportunities and challenges for stress engineering and stress modeling are considered and outlined.},

This review introduces the progress made in ALD, both for computational and experimental methodologies, and provides an outlook of this emerging technology in comparison with other film deposition methods. It discusses experimental approaches and factors that affect the deposition and presents simulation methods, such as molecular dynamics and computational fluid dynamics, which help determine and predict effective ways to optimize ALD processes, hence enabling the reduction in cost, energy waste and adverse environmental impacts. Specific examples are chosen to illustrate the progress in ALD processes and applications that showed a considerable impact on other technologies.},

   abstract = {Medical devices and medical device materials must be designed to achieve specific criteria for safety and performance. The criteria themselves may be constrained by physical, chemical, and material limitations, and by biochemical, molecular, and cellular processes within the body recognized to take place upon blood contact. In the latter case, responses can be favorable or unfavorable, partially controlled by learned approaches, for example antithrombotic drugs, or be uncontrollable by current experience and know-how. As such, determining what testing is required and which test results are acceptable and meaningful in the development of a new medical device can be complex. This chapter highlights some of the main considerations in the specific area of evaluation of blood-contacting medical devices and materials. It discusses the main factors that may impact the blood-device/material responses that can occur, and it provides examples of some of the most common observations and approaches to manage the response. As the international standard ISO 10993-4 has been and continues to be a major driving influence behind this aspect of the biological safety evaluation of materials and devices, the evolving direction of the standard is covered and controversies in testing are reviewed. Ultimately, appropriate care taken to evaluate and understand critical blood-device/material interactions in each unique application leads to predictive and safe use in humans.},

With the emergence of combination products, a paradigm shift is occurring that now requires biocompatibility to be designed into the device. In fact, next-generation medical devices will require enhanced biocompatibility by using, for example, pharmacological agents, bioactive coatings, nanotextures, or hybrid systems containing cells that control biologic interactions to have desirable biologic outcomes. The concept of biocompatibility is moving from a “do no harm” mission (i.e., nontoxic, nonantigenic, nonmutagenic, etc.) to one of doing “good,” that is, encouraging positive healing responses. These new devices will promote the formation of normal healthy tissue as well as the integration of the device into adjacent tissue. In some contexts, biocompatibility can become a disruptive technology that can change therapeutic paradigms (e.g., drug-coated stents). New database tools to access biocompatibility data of the materials of construction in existing medical devices will facilitate the use of existing and new biomaterials for new medical device designs. © 2008, SAGE Publications.

   abstract = {Prostate cancer (PCa) is the second leading cause of cancer deaths in American men. Early detection of PCa by blood tests for elevated levels of prostate-specific-antigen (PSA) has lead to early treatment and a reduction in death rates. However, PSA level alone does not distinguish between PCa and normal conditions that cause elevated PSA. Furthermore, because PCa can be a very slow growing cancer, even confirmation of PCa cells in a biopsy gives no indication whether the PCa will progress into active disease within the individual's lifetime. As a result many patients receive treatment that they may not need. Imaging is an attractive modality for the detection and characterization of disease because most techniques are non- or minimally invasive, nondestructive, provide dynamic real-time data, and allow for repeat measurements. In PCa, advanced imaging techniques could be useful for accurate staging of primary disease, restaging of recurrent disease, detection of metastatic lesions, and predicting the aggressiveness of the disease. This paper reviews the radionuclide based imaging agents for planar, single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), and positron emission tomography (PET) imaging currently used in the clinic and those under development for PCa. The former includes the bone agents technetium diphosphonates and F-18 fluoride, the metabolic agents 2-[(1)(8)F]fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG), and receptor targeted radiolabeled monoclonal antibodies including ProstaScint. The latter agents include C-11 acetate, C-11 and F-18 choline, C-11 and F-18 labeled 1-aminocyclobutane-1-carboxylic acid, radiolabeled androgen receptor binding compounds, radiolabeled peptides and small molecules for receptors over expressed either on prostate cancer itself or on the associated tumor neovasculature. Coregistration of PET or SPECT images with CT or MRI scans, improvements in imaging cameras, and image reconstruction algorithms have improved the quality of the images to the point where dual modality (radionuclide/CT or MRI) imaging with several agents can now be considered for staging of PCa. In addition, the high selectivity and rapid localization of many of the new agents under development portends promise for a greater use of radionuclide imaging for prostate cancer detection, characterization, and treatment monitoring.},

   abstract = {For around five decades, the size of the transistors has been shrinking, and thus the number of transistors in a single microelectronic chip has become possible to increase exponentially. That is, packing density is increasing. The main building block of chip in the semiconductor industry is the Metal Oxide Semiconductor Field Effect Transistor (MOSFET). But due to the shrinking of the transistor dimensions, the electrical characteristics of MOSFET are being degraded, which may halt the continuous downscaling of the transistor size. However, various generations ofMOSFET have emerged for which we may expect to continue this downscaling for few more years to enhance the computing and communication performance further. Therefore, this article reviews the history and evolution of Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor Field Effect Transistor (CMOS) technology and its application in semiconductor industry and also reviews the recent advances and status of mainstream CMOS as the dominating technology in Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI), current and future trends of RF MOSFETs, and applications of MOSFETs in high power RF electronics for telecommunication sectors. Current researches on advanced MOS and other devices in nano scale regime are discussed also with their structures and various applications. It is hoped that the CMOS will continue to dominate in the semiconductor electronics industry in the few more years to come.},

The main theme throughout ISO 10993-1 and the corresponding 2016 FDA guidance document on biocompatibility is that every medical device should be assessed for its specific risk to the end user. Since it is difficult to address all possible risks associated with a medical device, extractable and leachable testing can be used to help fill in gaps and fulfill the risk evaluation. Extractable and leachable testing and a scientifically sound assessment of this data is the main proposed method to minimize unnecessary in vivo testing. When conducted properly, this approach should result in a safe device while at the same time, achieve significant cost savings and decreased time-to-market. Chemistry is very important to medical device evaluations and Parts 18 and 19 of ISO 10993 are receiving greater emphasis as an integral part of the biological evaluation of devices. Considering the intrinsic worth of chemical and materials characterization, it seems likely that both will receive even more attention in the future.},

The document also states that biological safety evaluations “must be planned” in advance. It is a working document of execution. It should document what should be done, when it should be done and why. Thus the overall value of the biological safety evaluation plan is that it defines the evaluation of the unknown so that a sufficient amount of information can be evaluated and risk can clearly be understood and characterized.},

Since then, the Japanese authorities issued and revised Japanese guidelines, but there have been no marked changes in the basic way of thinking. In recent years international mutual understanding has progressed, Japan’s safety evaluation way such as exhaustive extraction method has been introduced into various parts of the ISO 10993 series, and the latest ISO 10993 has been adopted for Japanese guidance. The basic test methods used in Japan do not differ from those used outside Japan for most test items. However, there is a perception gap in sample preparation applied to these tests. In Japan, the basic stance is to eliminate all risks systematically. This stance is especially prominent in cytotoxicity tests, sensitization tests and genotoxicity tests. In addition, there is a perception gap also in classification of medical devices. Focusing on these points, this chapter outlines the Japanese guidance for biological safety tests of medical devices.},

Regulations and quality standards lay out the requirements for product validation, but it is left to each individual manufacturer to establish and maintain its own validation procedures. More recently, there has also been a change of emphasis in the regulations and standards encouraging the integration of validation into the development process. However, this poses particular challenges to the manufacturer since there is a distinct lack of guidance to assist this integration. This workbook provides the first real guidance on good design practices for medical device development.

   abstract = {Presented in this paper is a study of the biocompatibility of an atomic layer-deposited (ALD) alumina (Al2O3) thin film and an ALD hydrophobic coating on standard glass cover slips. The pure ALD alumina coating exhibited a water contact angle of 55° ± 5° attributed, in part, to a high concentration of -OH groups on the surface. In contrast, the hydrophobic coating (tridecafluoro-1,1,2,2-tetrahydro-octyl-methyl- bis(dimethylamino)silane) had a water contact angle of 108° ± 2°. Observations using differential interference contrast microscopy on human coronary artery smooth muscle cells showed normal cell proliferation on both the ALD alumina and hydrophobic coatings when compared to cells grown on control substrates. These observations suggested good biocompatibility over a period of 7 days in vitro. Using a colorimetric assay technique to assess cell viability, the cellular response between the three substrates can be differentiated to show that the ALD alumina coating is more biocompatible and that the hydrophobic coating is less biocompatible when compared to the control. These results suggest that patterning a substrate with hydrophilic and hydrophobic groups can control cell growth. This patterning can further enhance the known advantages of ALD alumina, such as conformality and excellent dielectric properties for biomicro electro mechanical systems (Bio-MEMS) in sensors, actuators, and microfluidics devices. © 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

The techniques include dip coating, spin coating, roll-to-roll coating, droplet-assisted deposition and electro-assisted deposition. The chapter presents briefly the different steps involved in the process of thin film formation that are common to all techniques. To have a better understanding, all available liquid deposition techniques are usually described with an identical sequence of successive steps: initial chemical solution formulation, solution spreading on the surface of the substrate, evaporation of the liquid solution layer, layer post-processing, and final treatment of the layer for stabilization. These steps can be addressed individually because they are separated in time. Important progress made in the past few decades highlights the importance of the evaporation conditions in controlling the structure of the coating, which is better achieved in dip coating.},

   abstract = {Surface properties of biomaterials can strongly influence biomaterial-host interactions. For this reason, coating processes open a wide range of possibilities to modulate the fate of a biomaterial in the body. This study evaluates the effect of a coating material intended for drug delivery capsules on biocompatibility and the release of reactive oxygen species (ROS), that is, respiratory burst in macrophages that indicates acute inflammation. In parallel with a new approach to develop drug-delivery capsules by directly coating solid-state drug particles, in this study, glass slides and silicon nanoparticles (NPs) were coated with aluminum oxide (Al2O3) using atomic layer deposition. Different sizes of NPs (20 and 310 nm) were suspended at different concentrations (10, 100, and 1000 μg/mL) and were evaluated. The homogeneous coating of slides was proved using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and the coating on NP was observed using transmission electron microscopy. Human dermal fibroblasts and human osteoblasts were able to proliferate on the coated slides and in the presence of a suspension of coated NPs (20 and 310 nm) at a low concentration (10 μg/mL). The macrophages released ROS only when in contact with NPs at a concentration of 1000 μg/mL, where the 20 nm NPs caused a higher release of ROS than the 310 nm NPs. This study shows that Al2O3 coatings do not affect the cells negatively and that the cell viability was compromised only when in contact with a high concentration (1000 μg/mL) of smaller (20 nm) NPs.},

   abstract = {Ultrathin and conformal films deposited using atomic layer deposition (ALD) can enhance the reliability and performance of micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) devices. Al2O3 ALD films are particularly useful because the Al2O3 ALD surface chemistry is very favorable and amenable to growth on a wide variety of substrates. Al2O 3 ALD can be utilized to deposit robust and reliable hydrophobic coatings. A thin Al2O3 ALD film is deposited and is used as a seed layer to prepare and optimize the MEMS surface for the subsequent attachment of the hydrophobic precursors. Once the Al2O 3-coated surface is prepared, non-chlorinated alkylsilanes are chemically bonded to the surface hydroxyl groups on the ALD seed layer. The film growth was monitored using an in situ quartz crystal microbalance, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and ex situ Auger electron spectroscopy. This deposition technique results in a dense and conformal hydrophobic film with a water contact angle of 108 ± 2°. When annealed in air to 300°C for 10 min, the hydrophobic ALD films remained hydrophobic with a contact angle greater than 90°. Using MEMS cantilever beam arrays, hydrophobic ALD-coated beams were determined to have an adhesion energy of 0.11 ± 0.03 mJ m -2 at 100% humidity as compared with an adhesion energy of 12 ± 1 mJ m-2 for the same beams without any coating. © 2005 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

The water contact angle test shows that the T-ALD Al2O3 films exhibited a hydrophobic surface, while the PE-ALD Al2O3 films were hydrophilic. The difference in the surface hydrophobicity is attributed to the carbon residue in Al2O3 films, as revealed by the X-ray photoelectron and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopies. The trend of hydrophobicity follows with the evolution of surface roughness of the T-Al2O3 films, indicating that the surface roughness contributed to the hydrophobicity as predicted by the Wenzel's mode. The result indicates that the surface hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity of the Al2O3 thin films can be modified and controlled by the deposition conditions of the ALD process.},

   abstract = {Context: This review focuses on positive surgical margins (PSM) in radical prostatectomy (RP). Objective: To address the etiology, incidence, and oncologic impact of PSM and discuss technical points to help surgeons minimize their positive margin rate. An evidence-based approach to assist clinicians in counseling patients with a PSM is provided. Evidence acquisition: A literature search in English was performed using the National Library of Medicine database and the following key words: prostate cancer, surgical margins, and radical prostatectomy. Seven hundred sixty-eight references were scrutinized, and 73 were selected for rigorous review based on their pertinence, study size, and overall contribution to the field. Evidence synthesis: In contemporary series, PSM are reported in 11-38% of patients undergoing RP. Although variability exists in the pathologic interpretation of surgical margins, PSM are associated with an increased hazard of biochemical recurrence (BCR) and local disease recurrence as well as the need for secondary cancer treatment. A posterolateral PSM appears to confer the greatest risk of recurrence, whereas the prognostic significance of positive apical margins remains controversial. The role of preoperative imaging and intraoperative frozen section analysis are being investigated to reduce margin positivity rates. Level-1 evidence indicates that adjuvant radiotherapy (RT) in men with PSM reduces BCR rates and clinical progression and possibly improves overall survival (OS). Conclusions: PSM in RP specimens are uniformly considered an adverse outcome. Regardless of approach (open or laparoscopic), attention to surgical detail is essential to minimize rates. For patients with a PSM destined to experience a cancer recurrence, RT is the only established treatment with curative potential. A randomized trial in patients with PSM comparing immediate postoperative RT to salvage RT is critically needed before definitive recommendations can be made. © 2008 European Association of Urology.},

Where there is a plasma as part of the deposition process it is possible to monitor the deposition process in real time using the light produced in the plasma. When the process goes wrong it is important to be able to monitor various factors such as gas composition, and techniques for this are described. Once the coating has been deposited it is also required to confirm that the coating meets the target specification using measurements to verify the functionality of the coating. Techniques for measuring the coating thickness, optical, electrical, and barrier properties are described.},

   abstract = {This paper presents a biosensor-CMOS platform for measuring the capacitive coupling of biorecognition elements. The biosensor is designed, fabricated, and tested for the detection and quantification of a protein that reveals the presence of early-stage cancer. For the first time, the spermidine/spermine N1 acetyltransferase (SSAT) enzyme has been screened and quantified on the surface of a capacitive sensor. The sensor surface is treated to immobilize antibodies, and the baseline capacitance of the biosensor is reduced by connecting an array of capacitors in series for fixed exposure area to the analyte. A large sensing area with small baseline capacitance is implemented to achieve a high sensitivity to SSAT enzyme concentrations. The sensed capacitance value is digitized by using a 12-bit highly digital successive-approximation capacitance-to-digital converter that is implemented in a 0.18 µm CMOS technology. The readout circuit operates in the near-subthreshold regime and provides power and area efficient operation. The capacitance range is 16.137 pF with a 4.5 fF absolute resolution, which adequately covers the concentrations of 10 mg/L, 5 mg/L, 2.5 mg/L, and 1.25 mg/L of the SSAT enzyme. The concentrations were selected as a pilot study, and the platform was shown to demonstrate high sensitivity for SSAT enzymes on the surface of the capacitive sensor. The tested prototype demonstrated 42.5 µS of measurement time and a total power consumption of 2.1 µW.},

Radiation incidents on a smartphone camera's Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor (CMOS) sensor creates a signal which can be isolated from a visible light signal to turn the smartphone into a radiation detector. This work aims to report a detailed investigation of a well-reviewed smartphone application for radiation dosimetry that is available for popular smartphone devices under a calibration protocol that is typically used for the commercial calibration of radiation detectors. The iPhone 6s smartphone, which has a CMOS camera sensor, was used in this study. Black tape was utilized to block visible light. The Radioactivity counter app developed by Rolf-Dieter Klein and available on Apple's App Store was installed on the device and tested using a calibrated radioactive source, calibration concrete pads with a range of known concentrations of radioactive elements, and in direct sunlight. The smartphone CMOS sensor is sensitive to radiation doses as low as 10 µGy/h, with a linear dose response and an angular dependence. The RadioactivityCounter app is limited in that it requires 4-10 min to offer a stable measurement. The precision of the measurement is also affected by heat and a smartphone's battery level. Although the smartphone is not as accurate as a conventional detector, it is useful enough to detect radiation before the radiation reaches hazardous levels. It can also be used for personal dose assessments and as an alarm for the presence of high radiation levels. Human beings are exposed to ionizing radiation from human-made and natural sources (terrestrial, cosmic, and internal radiation). The annual dose from background radiation differs from one place to another in the earth's crust. Nowadays, the increase of ionizing radiation in medicine (imaging and radiotherapy) and industrial activities and weapon increase public attention due to its possible effects. On average, general population receive 2.4 mSv (75%) and 0.6 mSv (25%) from natural and artificial exposure 1-3. The annual amount of background radiation has wide variability from about 2.0 to 8.0 mSv/year, depending on the altitude, location of the earth's surface, and human practices and activities 4. Public awareness of ionizing radiation and its risks has increased dramatically since the Fukushima accidents in the matter of the radiation risk from nuclear power plants and the release of radioactive materials 5. Radiation can be used in various applications, and approximately 23 million workers are occupationally exposed to ionizing radiation worldwide 6. Workers in medical imaging, security, environmental monitoring, and other fields need to be protected from high doses of ionizing radiation. Practical and easily accessible dose monitoring is therefore crucial to ensure the safety of workers and the public. Radiation dose measurements in hospitals and industrial settings have traditionally used Geiger-Muller counters as an alarming method due to its ability to amplify the signal. However, it cannot be used as a personal dosimeter because the signal is independent of the incident radiation that created it 7. Proper personal monitoring devices should have the ability to detect and register accumulated incident radiation for a specified period. Similarly, instruments that use a combination of scintillation and semiconductor detectors can provide excellent detection efficiency for high energy gamma rays, including information about incident energy. Though small scintillation detectors can be manufactured while maintaining excellent performance, they are quite expensive, OPEN},

   abstract = {Purpose: Intraoperative identification of prostate cancer (PCa) lymph node (LN) metastases (LNM) detected by preoperative PSMA PET/CT may be facilitated by PSMA radio-guided surgery (RGS) with use of a γ-probe. Earlier we demonstrated excellent performance of the 111In-labelled PSMA ligand DKFZ-617 ([111In]In-PSMA-617) in RGS for ex situ distinction of LN vs LNM at lymphadenectomy (LA) at a single LN level. In comparison with indium-111, technetium-99m has better physical properties for γ-probe measurements, better availability and lower radiation exposure for patients and medical personnel. Against this background, we evaluated the uptake of 99mTc-PSMA-I&S ligand at the level of single LN and its power to discriminate between unaffected LN and LNM. Methods: Six patients with PCa with the suspicion of LNM on preoperative PSMA-PET/CT underwent [99mTc]Tc-PSMA-I&S RGS (4 salvage LA, 2 primary LA) with intravenous injection of [99mTc]Tc-PSMA-I&S 24 h prior to surgery. Resected samples were isolated manually aiming at the level of single LN. Uptake measurements were done ex situ with a high-purity germanium detector. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was performed based on [99mTc]Tc-PSMA-I&S uptake expressed as lean body mass standard uptake value (SUL). Results: Separation of the tissue samples from 73 subregions resulted in 498 single samples. After final histopathology 356 LN, 160 LNM und 11 non-nodal PCa samples were identified. Median SUL of tumor-free samples (0.26) and samples with cancer (3.5) was significantly different (p < 0.0001). ROC analysis revealed an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.917 (95% CI 0.89–0.95). Using a SUL cutoff of 1.1, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive values were 76.6%, 94.4%, 89.4% and 86.9%. Conclusion: Ex situ analysis of [99mTc]Tc-PSMA-I&S uptake at single LN level showed good diagnostic performance for the ex situ distinction of tumor-bearing vs tumor-free LN during RGS.},

Improvement of thin film crystal quality and removal of void and pinhole defects will improve quality factor and functional yield. Epitaxial aluminum films with superb crystallinity, high surface smoothness, and interface sharpness were successfully grown on the c-plane of sapphire using sputter beam epitaxy. This study assesses the effects of varying substrate preparation conditions and growth and prebake temperatures on crystallinity and smoothness. X-ray diffraction and reflectivity measurements yield extensive Laue oscillations and Kiessig thickness fringes for films grown at 200 °C under 15 mTorr Ar, indicating excellent crystallinity and surface smoothness; moreover, an additional substrate preparation procedure which involves (1) a modified substrate cleaning procedure and (2) prebake at 700 °C in 20 mTorr O2 is shown by atomic force microscopy to yield nearly pinhole-free film growth while maintaining epitaxy and high crystal quality. The modified cleaning procedure is environmentally friendly and eliminates the acid etch steps common to conventional sapphire preparation, suggesting potential industrial application both on standard epitaxial and patterned surface sapphire substrates.},

   abstract = {A new paradigm of silicon technology is the ultra-thin chip (UTC) technology and the emerging applications. Very thin integrated circuits (ICs) with through-silicon vias (TSVs) will allow the stacking and interconnection of multiple dies in a compact format allowing a migration towards three-dimensional ICs (3D-ICs). Also, extremely thin and therefore mechanically bendable silicon chips in conjunction with the emerging thin-film and organic semiconductor technologies will enhance the performance and functionality of large-area flexible electronic systems. However, UTC technology requires special attention related to the circuit design, fabrication, dicing and handling of ultra-thin chips as they have different physical properties compared to their bulky counterparts. Also, transistors and other active devices on UTCs experiencing variable bending stresses will suffer from the piezoresistive effect of silicon substrate which results in a shift of their operating point and therefore, an additional aspect should be considered during circuit design. This thesis tries to address some of these challenges related to UTC technology by focusing initially on modelling of transistors on mechanically bendable Si-UTCs. The developed behavioural models are a combination of mathematical equations and extracted parameters from BSIM4 and BSIM6 modified by a set of equations describing the bending-induced stresses on silicon. The transistor models are written in Verilog-A and compiled in Cadence Virtuoso environment where they were simulated at different bending conditions. To complement this, the verification of these models through experimental results is also presented. Two chips were designed using a 180 nm CMOS technology. The first chip includes nMOS and pMOS transistors with fixed channel width and two different channel lengths and two different channel orientations (0° and 90°) with respect to the wafer crystal orientation. The second chip includes inverter logic gates with different transistor sizes and orientations, as in the previous chip. Both chips were thinned down to ∼20m using dicing-before-grinding (DBG) prior to electrical characterisation at different bending conditions. Furthermore, this thesis presents the first reported fully integrated CMOS-based ISFET microsystem on UTC technology. The design of the integrated CMOS-based ISFET chip with 512 integrated on-chip ISFET sensors along with their read-out and digitisation scheme is presented. The integrated circuits (ICs) are thinned down to ∼30m and the bulky as well as thinned ICs are electrically and electrochemically characterised. Also, the thesis presents the first reported mechanically bendable CMOS-based ISFET device demonstrating that mechanical deformation of the die can result in drift compensation through the exploitation of the piezoresistive nature of silicon. Finally, this thesis presents the studies towards the development of on-chip reference electrodes and biodegradable and ultra-thin biosensors for the detection of neurotransmitters such as dopamine and serotonin.},

At first, different types of device scaling will be presented together with the associated scaling law for the main device parameters. Based on the concept of the natural device length, it will be shown that there is better gate control over the channel for a vertical multiple gate fin-type of architecture compared with planar devices. The same goes for fully depleted (FD) silicon-on-insulator (SOI) technologies, using an ultrathin film and a thin buried oxide (BOX) layer. Ultimately, MOSFETs will take on a gate-all-around (GAA) nanowire (NW) configuration, possibly in a junctionless CMOS process. Later, lithography for downscaling is presented. In this section, the resolution enhancement techniques will be presented. Later, extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUVL) technology and electron beam lithography (EBL) will be described. In the next part, the necessity of so-called strain engineering will be briefly highlighted. Finally, possible scenarios for beyond CMOS devices will be discussed, including tunnel FETs (TFETs) and spintronic devices.},

   abstract = {The aim of this chapter is to review the issues associated with shallow junction formation in silicon and germanium CMOS. In a first part, some basic quantities will be defined with respect to dopants in semiconductors and the basic diffusion mechanism of dopant atoms will be reviewed. The important role played by the intrinsic point defects, namely, vacancies (Vs) and interstitials (Is), will be highlighted. In first order, one can state that dopant diffusion in Ge is dominated by vacancies, while mixed behavior can be expected for silicon. In a second part, different doping methods will be summarized, whereby the dominant one is still relying on an ion implantation and annealing scheme. At the same time, the issue of displacement damage as a source of point defects and enhanced diffusion will be outlined. This indicates the important role played by defect engineering in order to control diffusion and dopant activation. This is illustrated in more detail in two case studies: the diffusion of B in silicon and of n-type dopants in Ge. Boron diffuses through the interstitialcy mechanism, i.e., by B-I pairs in silicon (and Ge). The presence of excess interstitials in the end-of-range damage region acts as a source of the so-called transient-enhanced diffusion (TED) and of the formation of boron-interstitial clusters (BICs). It will be shown that, for example, co-implantation with C, which is an efficient interstitial trap in silicon, contributes to a suppression of TED. BICs, on the other hand, consume part of the excess interstitials, so that they also suppress TED at short annealing times, but at the same time they form an immobile B fraction which is inactive. At longer annealing, BICs dissolve and release interstitials, causing delayed TED. In the case of n-type dopants in Ge, it is shown that diffusion occurs through X-V pairs. This is characterized by a diffusion coefficient which increases with increasing active electron concentration. As will be shown, this results in concentration-enhanced diffusion, characterized by a box-like dopant profile and a limitation of the active level to a value well below the maximum solid solubility. Countermeasures for the successful activation of ultra-shallow n+ junctions in Ge will be discussed next. They mainly rely on co-implantation with other (non)-dopant impurities or on the use of self-interstitials to control the excess vacancies. The role of ultrashort annealing schemes and of high- or low-temperature implantations will also be pointed out. The chapter is wrapped up by a summary.},

This chapter begins with the basic definitions of strain and mismatch parameters. Then the uniaxial and biaxial strain design in MOSFETs and their benefits and drawbacks to increase the channel mobility are presented. On this track, this chapter continues to cover different techniques to induce strain in transistor structure with a focus on embedded Si1 - xGex or Si1 - yCyin S/D regions, dual-stress liners (DSL), and stress memorization technique (SMT). In this part, more attention is paid to selective epitaxy of SiGe where the pattern dependency behavior may result in strain variation within a chip or from chip to chip because of layout changes over processed wafers. Later, different models to estimate the critical thickness of strained Si1 - xGex materials for the global growth are described and the discussions extend to the growth on pattern substrates and nanoscaled transistors. Finally, different characterization tools to quantify strain amount in nanoscaled transistors have been demonstrated.},

   abstract = {The interconnect module is one of the key processing modules in ULSI CMOS technology. It takes care of the electrical signal transmission between the active devices in semiconductor chips. In the past, aluminum was used as an interconnection metal of advanced CMOS chips, where silicon oxide-based dielectrics were used as insulators between the aluminum metal lines. Owing to the continuous scaling of the critical dimensions (CD), the RC-time constant of the interconnect is becoming higher than that of the active devices. In order to reduce the interconnect delay time, copper has been introduced as an interconnect metal to reduce the resistance R, whereas low dielectric constant (low-k) materials were introduced as insulators to reduce the capacitance C. One of the important aspects of this new material introduction is the potentially reduced intermetal dielectric reliability, which is caused by the soft and porous low-k materials and the shrinking line spacings, and thus higher electrical field, in the copper interconnect system. In this chapter, the materials, process, integration, and reliability in advanced interconnect are summarized to present an overview of the engineering and scientific background of this advanced chip technology. This chapter consists of two major parts. The first part aims to present the scientific and engineering background for materials, process, and integration of advanced copper interconnects. It starts with the typical integration flows of copper damascene structures, wherein intermetal low-k dielectrics are integrated. The integration processes and schemes have significant impacts on intermetal low-k dielectric reliability. Then the classification methods of low-k dielectrics are introduced and the basic properties of common low-k dielectrics are presented. Afterward, the effect of a major contaminant in the back-end-of-line (BEOL) structures-copper-is discussed, which is an important reliability concern for both silicon devices and intermetal dielectrics. This is followed by the discussion of the process and properties of one of the key influence factors for copper interconnects-copper diffusion barriers. The second part focuses on the reliability issues in advanced copper interconnect structures. First, the reliability of advanced metallization is discussed and the knowledge of electromigration (EM) and stress induced voiding is introduced, followed by a brief summary on the intermetal dielectric reliability. Two important reliability concerns, leakage and breakdown, are discussed. Finally, the commonly used reliability statistics and failure time distribution functions are presented to depict the statistical background for the BEOL reliability study. The alternatives of Cu/low-k for the future technology nodes are discussed at the last.},

It is well known that when the gate dielectric is scaled down to a thickness around 1 nm, the tunneling leakage through the dielectric increases to an unacceptable value, and the depletion layer formed in the polysilicon gate electrode and the dopant diffusion across the dielectric set a limit for further downscaling. The integration of high-κ/metal gate stacks is regarded as the most important technical revolution in CMOS technology after the introduction of the polysilicon gate in the 1960s. This chapter will give a technical review on the high-κ dielectric and metal gate, covering the limitation of the conventional gate stack using SiO2-based gate dielectric and polysilicon gate electrode, the benefits of high-κ and metal gate, and the current achievements in material selection, processing, and integration of high-κ dielectric and metal gate electrodes. Hafnium-based high-κ materials and compatible metal gate electrodes are discussed.

In this paper, we report the preparation and characterization of alumina films prepared by both electron beam evaporation and spray pyrolysis method. The electrical properties of alumina films were determined by measuring (C-V) and (I-V) characteristics in a metal oxide semiconductor (MOS) structure. A relative dielectric constant (ε r) of 9.6 for spray pyrolysed films and 8.3 for evaporated films was obtained. The breakdown electric field was found to be around 5 and 1 MV/cm, respectively for spray pyrolysed and evaporated films. The refractive index of alumina films by evaporation was found to be 1.71 and 1.61 at 275 and 500 nm, respectively. The optical band gap of spray pyrolysed films deposited at 300 • C was found to be in the range of 5.40-5.55 eV. Structural, elemental analysis and stoichiometry of the films was studied by scanning electron microscope (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDAX), Auger electron spectroscopy (AES) and Rutherford back scattering (RBS) spectra.},

   abstract = {Technetium-99m (99m Tc) has emerged as the most widely used radionuclide in medicine and is currently obtained from a 99 Mo/ 99m Tc generator system. At present, there are only a handful of ageing reactors worldwide capable of producing large quantities of the parent isotope, 99 Mo, and owing to the ever growing shutdown periods for maintenance and repair of these ageing reactors, the reliable supply 99m Tc has been compromised in recent years. With an interest in alternative strategies for producing this key medical isotope, this thesis focuses on several technical challenges related to the direct cyclotron production of 99m Tc via the 100 Mo(p,2n) 99m Tc reaction. In addition to evaluating the 100 Mo(p,2n) 99m Tc and 100 Mo(p,x) 99 Mo reactions, this work presented the first experimental evaluation of the 100 Mo(p,2n) 99g Tc excitation function in the range of 8-18 MeV. Thick target calculations suggested that large quantities of cyclotron-produced 99m Tc may be possible. For example, a 6 hr irradiation at 500 µA with an energy window of 18à10 MeV is expected to yield 1.15 TBq of 99m Tc. The level of coproduced 99g Tc contaminant was found to be on par with the current 99 Mo/ 99m Tc generator standard eluted with a 24 hr frequency. Highly enriched 100 Mo was required as the target material for 99m Tc production and a process for recycling of this expensive material is presented. An 87% recovery yield is reported, including metallic target preparation, irradiation, 99m Tc extraction, molybdate isolation, and finally hydrogen reduction to the metal. Further improvements are expected with additional optimization experiments. A method for forming structurally stable metallic molybdenum targets has also been developed. These targets are capable of withstanding more than a kilowatt of beam power and the reliable production and extraction of Curie quantities of 99m Tc has been demonstrated. With the end-goal of using the cyclotron-produced 99m Tc clinically, the quality of the cyclotron-produced 99m Tc has been extensively compared with relevant United States Pharmacopeia (USP) specifications for the existing 99 Mo/ 99m Tc production strategy. Additional quality testing, including biodistribution studies of [ 99m Tc]pertechnetate and [ 99m Tc]disofenin in both mice and rabbits was also evaluated. Using the strategies and results presented throughout this dissertation, this thesis concludes with the},

However, the use of electrons for imaging may result in several inadvertent effects that can potentially change the microstructure and mechanisms active in the material being investigated. In this study, in situ TEM characterization is performed on nanocrystalline nickel samples under self-ion irradiation and post irradiation annealing. During annealing, voids are formed around 200°C only in the area illuminated by the electron beam. Based on diffraction patterns analyses, it is hypothesized that the electron beam enhanced the growth of a NiO layer resulting in a decrease of vacancy mobility during annealing. The electron beam used to investigate self-ion irradiation ultimately significantly affected the type of defects formed and the final defect microstructure.},

Using this method, an average reflectance of 88.6% was achieved in the wavelength range of 400-800 nm.

   abstract = {Background 99mTc-MIP-1404 (Progenics Pharmaceuticals, Inc, New York, NY) is a novel ligand binding to prostate-specific membrane antigen suitable for SPECT. There are, as yet, no data concerning its use in whole-body primary staging and its interobserver variability in patients with prostate cancer (PC) prior to therapy. Methods A search of our clinical database from April 2013 to May 2017 yielded 93 patients with histologically confirmed cancer in whom 99mTc-MIP-1404 SPECT/CT had been performed for primary whole-body staging before therapy. Whole-body planar and SPECT/CT images of the lower abdomen and thorax had been obtained 3 to 4 hours postinjection of 706 ± 72 MBq 99mTc-MIP-1404. Images were visually analyzed for extent and location of abnormal uptake by 2 experienced nuclear physicians. Interobserver agreement for detection of primary tumor and metastatic lesions was assessed. In addition, SUVs of prostate-specific membrane antigen-positive regions of the prostate were determined in all patients, and from these, a variable reflecting total tumor load in the prostate gland was calculated (TUprostate). Follow-up reports of subsequent therapeutic interventions were available in 52 (56%) of all patients with a median follow-up of 18 months. Results In 90 (97%) of 93 patients, prostate uptake above background was detected as correlate of the histologically diagnosed PC. Forty-eight lymph node and 29 bone metastases were detected in 16 and 9 patients, respectively. In addition, 3 patients had disseminated bone metastases. No distant organ metastases were found. Interobserver agreement was high for the overall scan result (97%), as well as for the detection of the primary tumor (97%), of lymph node metastases (97%), and of bone metastases (99%). Recurrence of PC occurred in 5 patients in whom follow-up was available (10%). TUprostate was significantly higher in patients with Gleason scores of 8 or greater compared with patients with Gleason scores of 7 or less and at prostate-specific antigen (PSA) serum levels of 10 ng/mL or greater compared with PSA serum levels of 10 ng/mL or less. TUprostate of greater than 26 in the primary tumor predicted the occurrence of lymph node or bone metastases with a sensitivity of 82% and specificity of 76%. Conclusions MIP-1404 SPECT/CT has a high accuracy and low interobserver variability in the diagnosis of PC and allows detection of lymph node and bone metastases in a significant proportion of as yet untreated PC patients. TUprostate is correlated with Gleason score and PSA serum concentration and allows prediction of the occurrence of lymph node and bone metastases with moderate accuracy at primary staging.},

We used two simple phenomenological models, the Lorentz-Drude LD and the Brendel-Bormann BB, to interpret both the free-electron and the interband parts of the dielectric response of metals in a wide spectral range from 0.1 to 6 eV. Our results show that the BB model was needed to describe appropriately the interband absorption in noble metals, while for Al, Be, and the transition metals both models exhibit good agreement with the experimental data. A comparison with measurements on surface normal structures confirmed that the reflectance and the phase change on reflection from semiconductor-metal interfaces including the case of metallic multilayers can be accurately described by use of the proposed models for the optical functions of metallic films and the matrix method for multilayer calculations.},

   abstract = {This paper presents a biosensor-CMOS platform for measuring the capacitive coupling of biorecognition elements. The biosensor is designed, fabricated, and tested for the detection and quantification of a protein that reveals the presence of early-stage cancer. For the first time, the spermidine/spermine N1 acetyltransferase (SSAT) enzyme has been screened and quantified on the surface of a capacitive sensor. The sensor surface is treated to immobilize antibodies, and the baseline capacitance of the biosensor is reduced by connecting an array of capacitors in series for fixed exposure area to the analyte. A large sensing area with small baseline capacitance is implemented to achieve a high sensitivity to SSAT enzyme concentrations. The sensed capacitance value is digitized by using a 12-bit highly digital successive-approximation capacitance-to-digital converter that is implemented in a 0.18 μm CMOS technology. The readout circuit operates in the near-subthreshold regime and provides power and area efficient operation. The capacitance range is 16.137 pF with a 4.5 fF absolute resolution, which adequately covers the concentrations of 10 mg/L, 5 mg/L, 2.5 mg/L, and 1.25 mg/L of the SSAT enzyme. The concentrations were selected as a pilot study, and the platform was shown to demonstrate high sensitivity for SSAT enzymes on the surface of the capacitive sensor. The tested prototype demonstrated 42.5 μS of measurement time and a total power consumption of 2.1 μW.},

Many cancers are diagnosed late, leading to costly treatment and reduced life expectancy. With prostate cancer, the absence of a reliable test has inhibited the adoption of screening programs. We report a microelectronic point-of-care metabolite biomarker measurement platform and use it for prostate cancer detection. The platform, using an array of photodetectors configured to operate with targeted, multiplexed, colorimetric assays confined in monolithically integrated passive microfluidic channels, completes a combined assay of 4 metabolites in a drop of human plasma in under 2 min. A preliminary clinical study using l-amino acids, glutamate, choline, and sarcosine was used to train a cross-validated random forest algorithm. The system demonstrated sensitivity to prostate cancer of 94% with a specificity of 70% and an area under the curve of 0.78. The technology can implement many similar assay panels and hence has the potential to revolutionize low-cost, rapid, point-of-care testing.},

Materials and methods A 4-panel MNS autoantibody assay and a MNS protein assay were developed and optimized in our labs. Using these assays, serum concentration of six biomarkers including prostate-specific antigen (PSA) protein, free/total PSA ratio, as well as four autoantibodies against Parkinson disease 7 (PARK7), TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TARDBP), Talin 1 (TLN1), and Caldesmon 1 (CALD1) and were analyzed. Human serum samples from 99 patients (50 with non-cancer and 49 with clinically localized CaP) were evaluated. Results The MNS assay showed excellent performance characteristics and no cross-reactivity. All autoantibody assays showed a statistically significant difference between CaP and non-cancer samples except for PARK7. The most significant difference was the combination of the four autoantibodies as a panel in addition to the free/total PSA ratio. This combination had the highest area under the curve (AUC)- 0.916 in ROC analysis. Conclusions Our results suggest that this autoantibody panel along with PSA and free PSA have potential to segregate patients without cancer from those with prostate cancer with higher sensitivity and specificity than PSA alone.},

Objective: To show the applicability of combining preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative sentinel node imaging using an integrated diagnostic approach based on an imaging agent that is both radioactive and fluorescent. Design, setting, and participants: Before surgery, multimodal indocyanine green (ICG)- 99mTc-NanoColl was injected into the prostate. Subsequent lymphoscintigraphy and single-photon emission computed tomography/computed tomography (SPECT/CT) imaging of pelvic nodes was performed to determine the location of the sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) preoperatively. During the surgical procedure a fluorescence laparoscope, optimized for detection in the near infrared range, was used to visualize the nodes identified on SPECT/CT. Eleven patients scheduled for robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy (RALP) with an increased risk of nodal metastasis, based on Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center/Kattan nomogram estimation, participated in a pilot assessment (N09IGF). Surgical procedure: Patients underwent RALP with LN dissection for prostate cancer. Measurements: Radioactive and fluorescent signals were monitored using different modalities, and the correlation between the two types of signals was studied. The location of preoperatively detected SLNs was documented. Results and limitations: Preoperatively, SLNs were identified by SPECT/CT, and the multimodal nature of the imaging agent also enabled intraoperative detection via fluorescence imaging. Fluorescence particularly improved surgical guidance in areas with a high radioactive background signal such as the injection site. Ex vivo analysis revealed a strong correlation between the radioactive and fluorescent content in the excised LNs. Fluorescence detection is limited by the severe tissue attenuation of the signal. Therefore, radio guidance to the areas of interest is still desirable. Conclusions: Initial data indicate that multimodal ICG- 99mTc- NanoColloid, in combination with a laparoscopic fluorescence laparoscope, can be used to facilitate and optimize dissection of SLNs during RALP procedures. © 2011 European Association of Urology.},

   abstract = {Context: The main challenge in radical prostatectomy is complete excision of malignant tissue, while preserving continence and erectile function. Positive surgical margins (PSMs) occur in up to 38% of cases, are associated with tumour recurrences, and may result in debilitating additional therapies. Despite surgical developments for prostate cancer (PCa), no technology is yet implemented to assess surgical margins of the entire prostatic surface intraoperatively. Objective: The aim of this systematic review is to provide an overview of novel imaging methods developed for intraoperative margin assessment in PCa surgery, which are compared with standard postoperative histopathology. Evidence acquisition: A literature search of the last 10 yr was conducted in the Scopus, PubMed, and Embase (Ovid) databases. Eligible articles had to report the PSM rate according to their intraoperative margin assessment technology in comparison with standard histopathology. Evidence synthesis: The search resulted in 616 original articles, of which 11 were included for full-text review. The main technical developments in PCa margin assessment included optical coherence tomography, photodynamic diagnosis with 5-aminolevulinic acid, spectroscopy, and enhanced microscopy. These techniques are described and their main advantages, limitations, and applications in the clinical setting are discussed. Conclusions: Several imaging methods are suggested in literature for the detection of positive margins during PCa surgery. Despite promising qualifications of the mentioned technologies, many struggle to find implementation in the clinic. Surgical conditions hampering the signal, long imaging times, and comparison with histopathology are mutual challenges. The next step towards reduction of PSMs in PCa surgery includes evaluation of these technologies in large clinical trials. Patient summary: In this review, new technologies are reported that can assist the surgeon by detecting insufficient removal of all tumorous tissue during surgery, instead of the standard postoperative histopathological assessment. Currently, it is not clear whether these technologies improve the patient outcome directly; however, the review shows potential future implementations.},

The grain size of aluminium film apparently increases and the roughness of the film surface decreases from 2.5 to 1.5 nm with increasing deposition rate.

The resistivity of the films decreases from 5=10 to 3=10 V m as the deposition rate increases from 10 to 33 nmymin.

   abstract = {Hillocks are protruding sections of a surface that can influence the electronic and mechanical properties of a thin film. In monolithic films, these hillocks are formed due to thermally induced stress gradients during deposition. In this study, the surface morphology of co-sputtered immiscible Cu-X (X is a body centered cubic (BCC) group V or VI metal) thin films is characterized to elucidate the conditions that lead to hillock formation. Cu-Ta and Cu-Mo-Ag films were co-deposited with physical vapor deposition (PVD) magnetron sputtering at 25, 400, 600, and 800°C. A significant number of homogeneously distributed surface hillocks were observed only in the 600 and 800°C films. High-angle annular dark field (HAADF) cross-sectional imaging revealed significant Cu agglomerations underneath the protruding features. For the Cu-Ta films, the Cu was enveloped in a Cu-Ta nanocrystalline matrix. For Cu-Mo-Ag, the Cu was surrounded by Mo-Ag concentration modulations. While thermal stress gradients arise during deposition of immiscible metal films, biaxial stress calculations and literature cases reveal that they are not solely responsible for hillock formation. The observed morphologies align with a surface diffusion kinetic model that evaluates diffusion length of adatoms during deposition as a function of deposition temperature. This indicates a phase separation driving force paired with the constituent elements' dissimilar mobilities at elevated deposition temperatures contribute to the presence of hillocks.},

On the contrary, the value of the solution resistance was observed to vary several times between 1.33E+04 to 1.53E+00 Ohms as a function of the increase of the sulphuric acid concentration from 0-10% H2SO4. In similar fashion to the polarization resistance, as the concentration of the sulphuric acid increased from 0-10% H2SO4, values of the alternating current impedance were found to vary several times between 1.94E+09 to 3.95E+05 Ohms, in a non-linear fashion. A similar behavior was observed on the values of the double layer capacitance as a function of the sulphuric acid increased, from 0-10% H2SO4, in which the values of the double layer capacitance was observed to change several times from 2.24E-09 to 2.53E-06 μF. The optimum thickness of the oxide film was detected (26.5 nm) at 8% H2SO4 of the sulphuric acid concentration. In order to determine the performance of the anodized aluminium-sheet in surrounding areas of Kuwait, a plan was arranged for such a field study. The field study consists of setting up four racks of sample panels in different locations in Kuwait. The racks were installed in the main field of Kuwait Institute for Scientific Research (KISR) in Shuwaikh area, in a residential area of South Sura area, in the main field of the Petroleum Research Department and Studies Center (PRSC) of Kuwait Institute for Scientific Research(KISR), in an industrial area of Ahmadi city, and in the main field of the fishery department of Kuwait Institute for Scientific Research(KISR) in a marine area of Salmia. The investigation planned to take a sheet each three months, for a 12 months duration, in order to determine the electrochemical parameters and the oxide film thickness of the sheets by the EIS technique in the field and to compare the data with those obtained in this report, at zero state. © (2012) Trans Tech Publications.},

   abstract = {We present results from measurements of the native oxide film thickness on four different industrial aluminum alloys and three different aluminum single crystals. The thicknesses were determined using X-ray reflectivity, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. In addition, atomic force microscopy was used for micro-structural studies of the oxide surfaces. The reflectivity measurements were performed in ultra-high vacuum, vacuum, ambient, nitrogen and liquid water conditions. The results obtained using X-ray reflectivity and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy demonstrate good agreement. However, the oxide thicknesses determined from the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy show a larger discrepancy from the above two methods. In the present contribution the reasons for this discrepancy are discussed. We also address the effect of the substrate type and the presence of water on the resultant oxide thickness.},

The scheme was established based on a combination of a fiber optic sensor of Fabry–Pérot interferometry and direct current (DC) electrochemical methods. The scheme was assembled in a way to simultaneously anodize the aluminum samples and to measure the thickness of the aluminum oxide film. The anodization process of aluminum sample was carried out in 4% sulfuric acid (H2SO4) solution by the DC methods at room temperature. The estimated thickness of the aluminum oxide film by the novel scheme was verified by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and electrochemistry measurements. This study shows that real time measurement of the thickness of aluminum oxide film is feasible as it closely matched the thickness determined by SEM and other electrochemistry techniques.},

   abstract = {In the present investigation, holographic interferometry was utilized for the first time to measure in situ the thickness of the oxide film, alternating current (A.C.) impedance, and double layer capacitance of aluminium samples during anodization processes in aqueous solution without any physical contact. The anodization process (oxidation) of the aluminium samples was carried out by the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), in different concentrations of sulphuric acid (0.5-2.5 % H2SO4) at room temperature. In the mean time, the real-time holographic interferometric was used to measure the thickness of anodized (oxide) film of the aluminium samples in aqueous solutions. Also, mathematical models were applied to measure the alternating current (A.C.) impedance, and double layer capacitance of aluminium samples by holographic interferometry, during anodization processes in aqueous solution. Consequently, holographic interferometric is found very useful for surface finish industries especially for monitoring the early stage of anodization processes of metals, in which the thickness of the anodized film, the A.C. impedance, and the double layer capacitance of the aluminium samples in sulphuric acid (0.5-2.5 % H2SO4) can be determined in situ. Futhermore, a comparison was made between the electrochemical values obtained from the holographic interferometry measurements and from measurements of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy(EIS) on aluminium samples in sulphuric acid (0.5-2.5 % H2SO4). The comparison indicates that there is good agreement between the obtained electrochemical data from both techniques. However, there is a drastic difference between the measurement of the oxide film thickness by both techniques. The oxide film thickness of the aluminium samples in 0, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5% H2SO4 by the optical interferometry is in a micrometer scale. However, the oxide film thickness of the aluminium samples in 0, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5% H 2SO4 by the E.I.Spectroscopy in a nanometer scale. This can be explained due to the fact that the E.I.Spectroscopy is useful technique to measure the electrochemical parameters and the thickness of the barrier (compact) oxide films. In contrast, the optical interferometry is found useful technique to characterize and measure the thickness of the porous oxide layer. Also, the optimum thickness of the oxide barrier film was detected to be equivalent to 0.612nm in sulphuric acid concentration of 2.5% H 2SO4 by E.I. spectroscopy.},

   abstract = {An electrochemically synthesised porous anodic aluminium oxide (pAAO) layer has been analysed by means of spectroscopic ellipsometry. The determined thickness of the formed pAAO layer obtained from spectroscopic ellipsometry measurements and modelling was 322.75 ± 0.12 nm. The radius of the nanopores estimated from SEM images was 39 ± 5 nm and the distance between nanopores was 107 ± 6 nm. The investigation of human serum albumin (HSA) adsorption on the pAAO coating showed that: (i) the protein concentration inside nanopores, depending on exposure time, approximately was from 200 up to 600 times higher than that determined in buffer solution; (ii) the initial phase of the adsorption process is slow (3.23 mg·cm−3·min−1) in comparison with the protein desorption rate (21.2 mg·cm−3·min−1) by means of pAAO layer washing; (iii) conventional washing with PBS solution and deionised water does not completely remove HSA molecules from pAAO pores and, therefore, the HSA concentration inside nanopores after 16 h of washing still remains almost 100 times higher than that present in PBS solution. Thus, due to such binding ability, HSA can be successfully used for the blocking of the remaining free surface, which is applied for the reduction in non-specific binding after the immobilisation of biorecognition molecules on the pAAO surface. It was determined that some desorption of HSA molecules from the pAAO layer occurred during the sensor’s surface washing step; however, HSA concentration inside the nanopores still remained rather high. These results recommend the continued application of pAAO in the development of biosensors.},

Thin aluminium film deposition is mainly accomplished via physical or chemical methods at varying deposition conditions, parameters and substrates. This study focuses on thin aluminium films prepared using physical methods which have superior properties to chemical methods and are extensively researched in the published literature. The review discusses the properties of thin aluminium films and their complex interactions with process parameters. The properties of thin films depend on the deposition parameters which include substrate temperature, deposition rate, power, process pressure, substrate surface finish, and target temperature. Post-deposition treatment of the films and the type of substrate also influence the properties of thin films. This review therefore highlights the significance of optimising the deposition methods and identifies research gaps in the published studies.

   abstract = {In this Letter, we report on a compilation of a self-con-si stent set of optical data, from 10-3 eV to 10 6 eV, of a few standard substances that are of both theoretical and practical interest. A comprehensive publication of our results 1 is available from the Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron DESY. That report contains numerical tables and graphs of the optical functions of the eight substances investigated: reflectivity R, absorption co­ efficient μ, energy loss-Imε-1 , refractive index n + ik, dielectric constant ε 1 + iε 2 , and the numerical evaluation of five sum rules. 2 The experiments were performed using the DESY electron synchrotron as a light source 3 and a fixed-exit-slit grazing-incidence monochromator. 4 A two-beam optical densitometer 5 provided accurate measurements of the transmittances of thin films between 13 eV and 150 eV photon energy. This energy range covers the critical region from 30 eV to 50 eV, where normal-in­ cidence monochromators have low flux output and ordi­ nary grazing-incidence monochromators suffer from the superposition of higher orders. The samples were prepared by vacuum evaporation (≈ 5× 10-7 torr during evaporation) as thin films; the thickness ranged from less than 100 Å to 600 Å. Spe­ cial precautions were taken to prevent subsequent oxida­ tion of the samples, by evaporating 50 Å carbon in situ onto both sides of the films. 6 The thicknesses of the films were controlled by an oscillating-quartz monitor that had an accuracy of ≾ ± 10 Å, which estimate could be supported by independent measurements. 1 The optical constants for the entire energy range were calculated by use of the Kramers-Kronig relations. This requires that one optical function be known from the infrared to the x-ray region. With our measure­ ments, we closed a gap in a region where a large num­ ber of electrons contribute to the optical behavior, and where, consequently, interpolations can be misleading. This is especially clear in the pioneering paper by Phil-ipp and Ehrenrich, 7 who calculated the optical constants of Al for the first time over an extended energy range, using experimental results together with interpolations. Their sum-rule check revealed a serious lack of oscil­ lator strength. We used one or another of three procedures for com­ parison of our data with those of other investigators. (1) If the absorption coefficient could be determined di­ rectly from the measured transmittance, and if μ val­ ues were available, a Kramers-Kronig analysis was performed with the absorption spectrum. (2) If only re­ flectance data were available in the infrared, visible and near-uv region, first the Kramers-Kronig relation was used to determine the phase change of the reflected beam, from which, together with the measured absorp­ tion in the vuv regime and in the x-ray region, 8 a com­ plete absorption spectrum was constructed. (3) For Au and Ag, the reflectance is great in the region between 20 eV and 50 eV; therefore the complete transmittance spectrum was constructed and a Kramers-Kronig rela­ tion was used to determine the phase change of the transmitted beam. 9 In Figs. 1-8, the final absorption coefficients μ are shown (full lines) as functions of photon energy.

The analysis of metal slanted columnar thin films fabricated by glancing angle deposition reveals their monoclinic optical properties and their optical response can be modeled with a single homogeneous biaxial layer. This homogeneous biaxial layer approach is universally applicable to sculptured thin films and effective optical properties of the nanostructured thin films are attained. We provide a nomenclature and categorization for sculptured thin films based on their geometry and structure. A piecewise homogeneous biaxial layer approach is described, which allows for the determination of principal optical constants of chiral and achiral multi-fold and helical sculptured thin films. It is confirmed that such sculptured thin films have modular optical properties. This characteristic can be exploited to predict the optical response of sculptured thin films grown with arbitrary sequential substrate rotations. As an alternative model approach, an anisotropic effective medium approximation based on the Bruggeman formula is presented, which provides results comparable to the homogeneous biaxial layer approach and in addition provides the volume fraction parameters for slanted columnar thin films and their depolarization factors.},

The el-lipsometer used in the experiments is the SE 850 photometric rotating analyzer ellipsome-ter from Sentech. After an introduction to ellipsometry and a problem description, the subjects of polarization and essential ellipsometry theory are covered. The index of refraction for silicon, aluminum , copper and silver are modelled using the Drude-Lorentz harmonic oscillator model and afterwards measured by ellipsom-etry. The results based on the measurements show a tendency towards, but are not adequately close to, the table values. The materials are therefore modelled with a thin layer of oxide, and the refractive indexes are computed. This model yields good results for the refractive index of silicon and copper. For aluminum the result is improved whereas the result for silver is not. The thickness of a thin film of SiO 2 on a sub-strate of silicon is measured by use of ellip-sometry. The result is 22.9 nm which deviates from the provided information by 6.5 %. The thickness of two thick (multiple wavelengths) thin polymer films are measured. The polymer films have been spin coated on substrates of silicon and the uniformities of the surfaces are investigated. The two polymer films are measured to be 3.32 and 4.17 µm on average with a maximum deviation from the mean across the surface of 3.0 % and 4.2 % respectively.},

The interesting characteristics, such as film thickness, surface roughness thickness and optical functions can be determined only by modeling the near-surface region of the sample. However, the measured quantities are not equivalent to those determined from the modeling. Ellipsometry measurements determine elements of the sample Mueller matrix, but the usual result of modeling calculations are elements of the sample Jones matrix. Often this difference is academic, but if the sample depolarizes the light, it is not. Ellipsometry calculations also include methods for determining the optical functions of materials. Data for bulk materials are usually accurate for substrates, but are not appropriate for most thin films. Therefore, reasonable parameteriza-tions are quite useful in performing spectroscopic ellipsometry data analysis. Recently, there has been an increased interest in anisotropic materials, both in thin-film and bulk form. A generalized procedure will be presented for calculating the elements of the Jones matrix for any number of layers, any one of which may or may not be uniaxial. 1998 Elsevier Science S.A.},

   abstract = {Summary Atomic electrons may be emitted from atoms as a result of a nuclear decay process referred to as internal conversion. In such a process an unstable nucleus decaying to a lower more stable state transmits its decay energy to an atomic electron, which is emitted from the atom with an energy corresponding to the nuclear decay energy less the binding energy of the electron to the atom. Another source of atomic electron radiation is the emission of Auger (pronounced OH-ZHAY) electrons. Auger electrons may be emitted by radioactive atoms, which have electron shell vacancies and undergo electron energy-level transitions. Radioactive atoms that decay by electron capture (EC) or internal-conversion (IC) decay processes leave vacancies in electron shells. When a vacancy occurs in an electron shell an outer electron will move to fill that vacancy. In such an electron energy-level transition, energy may be released in the form of either x-radiation or the energy of transition is transferred to an atomic electron emitted from the atom as an Auger electron. The origins and properties of IC and Auger electrons are described in this chapter.},

   abstract = {Single-photon sources and detectors underpin the development of quantum photonic technologies. This thesis presents research into single-photon devices with a focus on telecom wavelengths. A two-channel superconducting nanowire single-photon detector (SNSPD) system was constructed and characterised. It provides free-running single-photon detection at telecom wavelengths with low dark counts and timing jitter below 90 ps FWHM. The system detection efficiency at 1310 nm is 1 % with a 1 kHz dark count rate, which was competitive when the SNSPD was built in 2009. In this work, the low timing jitter of the SNSPD was beneficial to the development of a two-photon interference experiment. Experiments were carried out with single-photon sources based on self-assembled InAs/GaAs quantum dots in micropillar cavities. Preliminary measurements of the second-order correlation function gave g (2) (τ = 0) = 0.12 ± 0.04 with above-band excitation and g (2) (τ = 0) = 0.07 ± 0.05 with near-resonant excitation. These values agree with recent papers reporting improved measurements with near-resonant excitation. Irreparable damage to the sample prevented further investigation. This thesis also presents the design, construction and characterisation of a high-resolution single-photon spectrometer for telecom wavelengths. The instrument, a scanning Fabry-Pérot interferometer, was optimised for the characterisation of quantum photonic sources. It has a spectral resolution of ∼ 550 MHz and a free spectral range of (119.0 ± 0.4) GHz.},

GaTate, a somatostatin analog, has recently been accorded orphan drug status by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, thereby increasing interest in and availability of this radiotracer. GaTate PET/CT allows whole-body imaging of cell surface expression of somatostatin receptors (SSTRs) and is rapidly evolving as the new imaging standard of reference for the detection and characterization of NETs. The authors discuss the normal appearance at GaTate PET/CT and the utility of this modality in a variety of these tumors, including gastrointestinal, pancreatic, and bronchial NETs as well as pheochromocytoma, paraganglioma, meningioma, and oncogenic osteomalacia. In addition, they discuss potential causes of false-positive findings, including pancreatic uncinate process activity, inflammation, osteoblastic activity, and splenosis. They also highlight the complementary role of 2-[fluorine-18]fluoro-2-deoxy-d-glucose (FDG) PET/CT, including the advantages of using both GaTate PET/CT and FDG PET/CT to evaluate sites of well- and poorly differentiated disease. The use of GaTate PET/CT together with FDG PET/CT allows identification of tumor heterogeneity, which provides prognostic information and can be pivotal in guiding biopsy.

   abstract = {Nanoindentation is a valuable tool for extracting material properties such as elastic modulus and hardness at the nanoscale. Knowing material properties at this scale enhances the use of thin films as protective coatings and various electronic applications. It is essential that material behavior is well-known before manufacture to ensure material selection will prevent catastrophic failures. The research presented here has led to the creation of a model that extracts elastic modulus from the film or substrate, termed the Zhou-Prorok model, and has been tested on a wide variety of film/substrate combinations. Other researchers have been concerned with a change in area when the film and substrate have different elastic moduli; phenomena such as sink-in or pileup can occur, leading to a difference in contact area, the crucial term used to calculate the material properties. The model, however, is not affected elastically, and it is hypothesized that the plastic properties are the only effect on the pileup and sink-in. Within this work, new methods are outlined to characterize and measure projected pileup and sink-in. Additionally, yield stress was controlled prior to indentation, and pileup was then examined across a variety of plastically deforming substrates with metallic films. Overall, this research contributes a number of new findings of pileup and sink-in related to plasticity, and improves the field of nanoindentation as this new information can be utilized for the most accurate extraction of material properties from simple small-scale nanoindentation tests. iii Acknowledgements},

   abstract = { Interferometric and ellipsometric techniques are widely used in object characterization, investigation and testing. Both techniques are crucial for industrial sectors in manufacturing and production. In this work, an interferometric imaging ellipsometry method has been developed to measure the ellipsometric parameters Ψ , Δ and thickness t of native oxide layer formed on a copper thin film at wide angle of incidence 57.8–80.2º instantaneously. In this system, Michelson interferometer is illuminated with 45° polarized laser beam of 30 mm diameter. The produced fringes are split by a polarizing beam splitter (PBS) into p - and s - polarization fringes. The interferograms are captured separately by two CCD sensors at the reference and the measurement states without moving any parts in the optical system for each state. The detected p - and s - interferograms are analyzed using ImageJ software for mathematically calculating the values of Ψ , Δ and t of the oxide layer grown on copper thin film surface. The proposed method avoids the offset errors and the probable misalignment resulting from the beam and the optical components. In addition, it gathers the information of the interference pattern with the state of polarization of light for accurate, precise and real time contrast images. The oxide layer thickness is determined under controlled environment with high accuracy and low uncertainty. The results obtained by the proposed technique are consistent with the spectroscopic ellipsometer measurements. },

   abstract = {Nanoindentation is an established technique for the measurement of hardness and Young's modulus. However, the technique only uses normal forces that are far away from the conditions in most real applications. Usually, lateral forces due to friction act together with normal forces. In order to characterize a protecting coating more comprehensively, scratch tests are used additionally. But these tests normally do not deliver characteristic and comparable material parameters which are independent of the measurement conditions and can serve as input parameters for modeling calculations. This shall be overcome with the measurement of lateral force-displacement curves with the same accuracy as conventional nanoindentation can do in normal direction. We report on experiments with a newly developed device, the so-called lateral force unit. This unit was installed in a UMIS-2000 nanoindenter. We present a characterization of the experimental set-up and point out the new possibilities of measuring mechanical surface properties with such a device. The results of first lateral measurements will be discussed. © 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

This article reviewed the limitations of conventional SiO2 gate oxide and the reasons for replacement of SiO2. However, there are numerous materials and processes to be considered before jumping to a decision. The selection criteria and considerations for current gate oxides were described by Ashby’s approach owing to his simple and straightforward type of method.

The resulting morphology of the film, as characterised by AFM at different points along the scratch test, is very informative of the nature of the coating failure, and combined with FTIR studies of the oxides can explain the observed differences in the quantitative mechanical tests. As an illustration of the capability of these methods to distinguish differences between coatings on the same substrate with the same nominal chemistry, a comparison between three AlOx coatings on polyethylene naphthalate (PEN) is made. The different films were produced in comparable conditions by direct current (DC) magnetron sputtering, radio frequency (RF) magnetron sputtering and high power impulse magnetron sputtering (HiPIMS). Clear differences were measured between the coatings. The DC film showed the greatest strain-to-failure, perhaps due to a more open structure indicated by FTIR, and the HiPIMS sample showed a less homogeneous, but better adhered, coating. © 2012.},

Since its introduction two decades ago, robotic-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (RALP) has evolved to become the predominant surgical approach in many industrialized countries. Objective: To provide and highlight currently available literature regarding prostate anatomy and to help in improving oncological and functional outcomes in RALP. Methods/Evidence Acquiring: PubMed database was searched using the following keywords: “robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy,” “anatomy,” “neurovascular bundle,” “nerve,” “periprostatic fascia,” “pelvis,” “sphincter,” “urethra,” “urinary incontinence,” and “erectile dysfunction.” Relevant articles and book chapters were critically reviewed and if eligible, they were included in this review. Results: New evidence in regards to prostatic anatomy and surgical approaches in RALP has been reported in recent years. Besides detailed anatomical studies investigating the meticulous structure of the fascial structures surrounding the prostate and neurovascular bundle preservation, debate about the optimal RALP approach is still ongoing, inspired by recent publications presenting promising functional outcomes following modifications in surgical approaches. Conclusions: This review provides a detailed overview of the current knowledge of prostate anatomy, its surrounding tissue, and its influence on key surgical step development for RALP.},

   abstract = {Failure characteristics and adhesion evaluation of hydrogen-free amorphous carbon coatings (a-C and ta-C) were examined by scratch testing using different indenter tip radii. Based on previous work of some of the authors, this article provides an extended description of main failure modes occurring for brittle coatings, with respect to the ratio of indenter radius R to coating thickness h. For best control over expected coating failure, it is shown that the failure mode of the coating can be reliably predicted and adjusted by the choice of the indenter radius. Failure modes of interest are predominant spallations (failure mode II) and predominant bending cracks (failure mode II). Same failure modes were typically found within certain ranges of R/h: Failure mode II occurred for 20 < R/h < 40 and failure mode III for 100 < R/h < 200. For an enhanced adhesion evaluation, the concept of adhesion assessment by comparing the relative size of delaminated area was expanded and generalized for variable indenter sizes and failure mechanisms. Thus, this approach enables direct comparison of scratch results in case of similar R/h, especially allowing adhesion comparison for a wide range of coating thicknesses.},

   abstract = {Constant load scratch testing provides better differentiation of damage levels. However, the constant load scratch test requires more specimen surface and test time. Nevertheless, a constant load test provides a greater statistical confidence in the results. Such scratch tests are very popular for research and process development of coatings. In such tests, a series of scratches are produced with constant normal loads on a coating to obtain the critical loads. Each scratch is examined with an optical microscope for failure of the coating and the evaluation of the critical load. Depending upon the electrical characteristics of the coating and the substrate, acoustic emission (AE) and electrical contact resistance (ECR) data may also be monitored during the test to confirm the failure. A constant load scratch test can be performed either unidirectionally or in X-Y. In unidirectional scratching, the constant load scratch is performed by moving the stylus in one direction with a constant normal force. The schematic load and scratch width profiles for unidirectional scratch test are shown in Figures 3(A) and 3(B), respectively. An X-Y scratch is produced by moving the stylus alternately in the X and Y directions under a constant normal load. The schematic load and scratch path for an X-Y scratch are shown in Figures 4(A) and 4(B), respectively. In the X-Y scratch, the spacing between two successive scratches along the X-direction is gradually reduced, as is shown in Figure 4(B). The failure mode in such scratch test indicates the extent of flaw tolerance of the specimen. At the critical spacing, the failure takes place due to the presence of micro-cracks that were formed or subsurface stresses that were induced during prior scratching along one direction (X). lateral force (Fx) values are recorded along with test time and scratch distance. In addition, it is preferable to record the acoustic emission (AE) and electrical contact resistance (ECR) data, which are very vital to precisely detect subsurface and incipient failure. The scratch failure-mode of the coating is examined by an optical microscope after the test. The normal load at which such failure occurs is known as the critical load (Lc). There may be a number of critical loads corresponding to each mode of failure. The critical load is a function of a number of factors, including the adhesion strength between the coating and the substrate, radius of the stylus or scratch-tip, loading rate (N·s-1), mechanical properties of the substrate and the coating, coating thickness, internal stress in the coating, flaw-size distribution in the coating and at the coating-substrate interface, and the coefficient of friction between the stylus and the coating. 3 Progressive load scratch test covers the complete load range with a single test. Therefore, it is faster than other types of scratch tests. The test is suitable for rapid assessment and QC of coatings and thin films. One of the progressively increasing load tests is the linear scratch test. The schematic load and scratch-width profiles for a linear scratch test are shown in Figures 1(A) and 1(B), respectively. As the linear scratch progresses with increasing normal force, the width of the scratch also increases, as indicated schematically in Figure 1(B). Another type of progressive load scratch test is zigzag scratch. In this test, the stylus oscillates along one (Y) direction while, at the same time, a scratch test is performed with increasing load along the perpendicular (X) direction. The load and scratch-width profiles for such a test are shown in Figures 2(A) and 2(B), respectively. Under zigzag test, a series of micro-scratches are produced during scratching by oscillation of the stylus in Y direction. The zigzag scratch test is very useful to find out the scratch adhesion values of soft and/or thin coatings. Figure 1.
